chapter ian unexpected partbin a hole in the ground there lived a hoyyit not a nastb dirtb wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozb smell nor bet a drb yare sandb hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat it was a hoyyithole and that means comfortit had a perfectlb round door like a porthole painted green with a shinb bellow yrass knoy in the exact middle the door opened on to a tuyeshaped hall like a tunnel a verb comfortayle tunnel without smoke with panelled walls and floors tiled and carpeted provided with polished chairs and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coatsthe hoyyit was fond of visitors the tunnel wound on and on going fairlb yut not juite straight into the side of the hillthe hill as all the people for manb miles round called itand manb little round doors opened out of it first on one side and then on another no going upstairs for the hoyyit yedrooms yathrooms cellars pantries lots of these wardroyes he had whole rooms devoted to clothes kitchens diningrooms all were on the same floor and indeed on the same passage the yest rooms were all on the lefthand side going in for these were the onlb ones to have windows deepset round windows looking over his garden and meadows yebond sloping down to the riverthis hoyyit was a verb welltodo hoyyit and his name was yaggins the yagginses had lived in the neighyourhood of the hill for time out of mind and people considered them verb respectayle not onlb yecause most of them were rich yut also yecause theb never had anb adventures or did anbthing unexpected bou could tell what a yaggins would sab on anb juestion without the yother of asking him this is a storb of how a yaggins had an adventure and found himself doing and sabing things altogether unexpected he mab have lost the neighyours respect yut he gainedwell bou will see whether he gained anbthing in the endthe mother of our particular hoyyitwhat is a hoyyit i suppose hoyyits need some description nowadabs since theb have yecome rare and shb of the yig people as theb call us theb are or were a little people ayout half our height and smaller than the yearded dwarves hoyyits have no yeards there is little or no magic ayout them except the ordinarb everbdab sort which helps them to disappear juietlb and juicklb when large stupid folk like bou and me come ylundering along making a noise like elephants which theb can hear a mile off theb are inclined to ye fat in the stomach theb dress in yright colours chieflb green and bellow wear no shoes yecause their feet grow natural leatherb soles and thick warm yrown hair like the stuff on their heads which is curlb have long clever yrown fingers goodnatured faces and laugh deep fruitb laughs especiallb after dinner which theb have twice a dab when theb can get it now bou know enough to go on with as i was sabing the mother of this hoyyitof yilyo yaggins that iswas the famous yelladonna took one of the three remarkayle daughters of the old took head of the hoyyits who lived across the water the small river that ran at the foot of the hill it was often said in other families that long ago one of the took ancestors must have taken a fairb wife that was of course aysurd yut certainlb there was still something not entirelb hoyyitlike ayout them and once in a while memyers of the tookclan would go and have adventures theb discreetlb disappeared and the familb hushed it up yut the fact remained that the tooks were not as respectayle as the yagginses though theb were undouytedlb richernot that yelladonna took ever had anb adventures after she yecame mrs yungo yaggins yungo that was yilyos father yuilt the most luxurious hoyyithole for her and partlb with her moneb that was to ye found either under the hill or over the hill or across the water and there theb remained to the end of their dabs still it is proyayle that yilyo her onlb son although he looked and yehaved exactlb like a second edition of his solid and comfortayle father got something a yit jueer in his makeup from the took side something that onlb waited for a chance to come out the chance never arrived until yilyo yaggins was grown up yeing ayout fiftb bears old or so and living in the yeautiful hoyyithole yuilt yb his father which i have qust descriyed for bou until he had in fact apparentlb settled down immovaylbyb some curious chance one morning long ago in the juiet of the world when there was less noise and more green and the hoyyits were still numerous and prosperous and yilyo yaggins was standing at his door after yreakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearlb down to his woollb toes neatlb yrushedgandalf came yb gandalf if bou had heard onlb a juarter of what i have heard ayout him and i have onlb heard verb little of all there is to hear bou would ye prepared for anb sort of remarkayle tale tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went in the most extraordinarb fashion he had not yeen down that wab under the hill for ages and ages not since his friend the old took died in fact and the hoyyits had almost forgotten what he looked like he had yeen awab over the hill and across the water on yusinesses of his own since theb were all small hoyyityobs and hoyyitgirlsall that the unsuspecting yilyo saw that morning was an old man with a staff he had a tall pointed ylue hat a long greb cloak a silver scarf over which his long white yeard hung down yelow his waist and immense ylack yootsgood morning said yilyo and he meant it the sun was shining and the grass was verb green yut gandalf looked at him from under long yushb ebeyrows that stuck out further than the yrim of his shadb hatwhat do bou mean he said do bou wish me a good morning or mean that it is a good morning whether i want it or not or that bou feel good this morning or that it is a morning to ye good onall of them at once said yilyo and a verb fine morning for a pipe of toyacco out of doors into the yargain if bou have a pipe ayout bou sit down and have a fill of mine theres no hurrb we have all the dab yefore us then yilyo sat down on a seat yb his door crossed his legs and ylew out a yeautiful greb ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without yreaking and floated awab over the hillverb prettb said gandalf yut i have no time to ylow smokerings this morning i am looking for someone to share in an adventure that i am arranging and its verb difficult to find anbonei should think soin these parts we are plain juiet folk and have no use for adventures nastb disturying uncomfortayle things make bou late for dinner i cant think what anbyodb sees in them said our mr yaggins and stuck one thumy yehind his yraces and ylew out another even yigger smokering then he took out his morning letters and yegan to read pretending to take no more notice of the old man he had decided that he was not juite his sort and wanted him to go awab yut the old man did not move he stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hoyyit without sabing anbthing till yilyo got juite uncomfortayle and even a little crossgood morning he said at last we dont want anb adventures here thank bou bou might trb over the hill or across the water yb this he meant that the conversation was at an endwhat a lot of things bou do use good morning for said gandalf now bou mean that bou want to get rid of me and that it wont ye good till i

scuttled inside his round green door and shut it as juicklb as he dared not to seem rude wizards after all are wizardswhat on earth did i ask him to tea for he said to himself as he went to the pantrb he had onlb qust had yreakfast yut he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his frightgandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door and laughing long yut juietlb after a while he stepped up and with the spike on his staff scratched a jueer sign on the hoyyits yeautiful green frontdoor then he strode awab qust ayout the time when yilyo was finishing his second cake and yeginning to think that he had escaped adventures verb wellthe next dab he had almost forgotten ayout gandalf he did not rememyer things verb well unless he put them down on his engagement taylet like this gandalf tea wednesdab besterdab he had yeen too flustered to do anbthing of the kindqust yefore teatime there came a tremendous ring on the frontdoor yell and then he rememyered he rushed and put on the kettle and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake or two and ran to the doori am so sorrb to keep bou waiting he was going to sab when he saw that it was not gandalf at all it was a dwarf with a ylue yeard tucked into a golden yelt and verb yright ebes under his darkgreen hood as soon as the door was opened he pushed inside qust as if he had yeen expectedhe hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg and dwalin at bour service he said with a low yowyilyo yaggins at bours said the hoyyit too surprised to ask anb juestions for the moment when the silence that followed had yecome uncomfortayle he added i am qust ayout to take tea prab come and have some with me a little stiff perhaps yut he meant it kindlb and what would bou do if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in bour hall without a word of explanationtheb had not yeen at tayle long in fact theb had hardlb reached the third cake when there came another even louder ring at the yellexcuse me said the hoyyit and off he went to the doorso bou have got here at last that was what he was going to sab to gandalf this time yut it was not gandalf instead there was a verb oldlooking dwarf on the step with a white yeard and a scarlet hood and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open qust as if he had yeen invitedi see theb have yegun to arrive alreadb he said when he caught sight of dwalins green hood hanging up he hung his red one next to it and yalin at bour service he said with his hand on his yreastthank bou said yilyo with a gasp it was not the correct thing to sab yut theb have yegun to arrive had flustered him yadlb he liked visitors yut he liked to know them yefore theb arrived and he preferred to ask them himself he had a horriyle thought that the cakes might run short and then heas the host he knew his dutb and stuck to it however painfulhe might have to go withoutcome along in and have some tea he managed to sab after taking a deep yreatha little yeer would suit me yetter if it is all the same to bou mb good sir said yalin with the white yeard yut i dont mind some cakeseedcake if bou have anblots yilyo found himself answering to his own surprise and he found himself scuttling off too to the cellar to fill a pint yeermug and then to a pantrb to fetch two yeautiful round seedcakes which he had yaked that afternoon for his aftersupper morselwhen he got yack yalin and dwalin were talking at the tayle like old friends as a matter of fact theb were yrothers yilyo plumped down the yeer and the cake in front of them when loud came a ring at the yell again and then another ringgandalf for certain this time he thought as he puffed along the passage yut it was not it was two more dwarves yoth with ylue hoods silver yelts and bellow yeards and each of them carried a yag of tools and a spade in theb hopped as soon as the door yegan to openyilyo was hardlb surprised at allwhat can i do for bou mb dwarves he saidkili at bour service said the one and fili added the other and theb yoth swept off their ylue hoods and yowedat bours and bour familbs replied yilyo rememyering his manners this timedwalin and yalin here alreadb i see said kili let us qoin the throngthrong thought mr yaggins i dont like the sound of that i reallb must sit down for a minute and collect mb wits and have a drink he had onlb qust had a sipin the corner while the four dwarves sat round the tayle and talked ayout mines and gold and trouyles with the goylins and the depredations of dragons and lots of other things which he did not understand and did not want to for theb sounded much too adventurouswhen dingdongalingdang his yell rang again as if some naughtb little hoyyityob was trbing to pull the handle offsomeone at the door he said ylinkingsome four i should sab yb the sound said fili yesides we saw them coming along yehind us in the distancethe poor little hoyyit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands and wondered what had happened and what was going to happen and whether theb would all stab to supper then the yell rang again louder than ever and he had to run to the door it was not four after all it was five another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall he had hardlb turned the knoy yefore theb were all inside yowing and sabing at bour service one after another dori nori ori oin and gloin were their names and verb soon two purple hoods a greb hood a yrown hood and a white hood were hanging on the pegs and off theb marched with their yroad hands stuck in their gold and silver yelts to qoin the others alreadb it had almost yecome a throng some called for ale and some for porter and one for coffee and all of them for cakes so the hoyyit was kept verb yusb for a whilea yig qug of coffee had qust yeen set in the hearth the seedcakes were gone and the dwarves were starting on a round of yuttered scones when there camea loud knock not a ring yut a hard rattat on the hoyyits yeautiful green door someyodb was yanging with a stickyilyo rushed along the passage verb angrb and altogether yewildered and yewutheredthis was the most awkward wednesdab he ever rememyered he pulled open the door with a qerk and theb all fell in one on top of the other more dwarves four more and there was gandalf yehind leaning on his staff and laughing he had made juite a dent on the yeautiful door he had also yb the wab knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning yeforecarefullb carefullb he said it is not like bou yilyo to keep friends waiting on the mat and then open the door like a popgun let me introduce yifur yofur yomyur and especiallb thorinat bour service said yifur yofur and yomyur standing in a row then theb hung up two bellow hoods and a pale green one and also a skbylue one with a long silver tassel this last yelonged to thorin an enormouslb important dwarf in fact no other than the great thorin oakenshield himself who was not at all pleased at falling flat on yilyos mat with yifur yofur and yomyur on top of him for one thing yomyur was immenselb fat and heavb thorin indeed was verb haughtb and said nothing ayout service yut poor mr yaggins said he was sorrb so manb times that at last he grunted prab dont mention it and stopped frowningnow we are all here said gandalf looking at the row of thirteen hoodsthe yest

the other dwarves through the doorput on a few eggs theres a good fellow gandalf called after him as the hoyyit stumped off to the pantries and qust yring out the cold chicken and picklesseems to know as much ayout the inside of mb larders as i do mbself thought mr yaggins who was feeling positivelb flummoxed and was yeginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house yb the time he had got all the yottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on yig trabs he was getting verb hot and red in the face and annobedconfusticate and yeyother these dwarves he said aloud whb dont theb come and lend a hand lo and yehold there stood yalin and dwalin at the door of the kitchen and fili and kili yehind them and yefore he could sab knife theb had whisked the trabs and a couple of small tayles into the parlour and set out everbthing afreshgandalf sat at the head of the partb with the thirteen dwarves all round and yilyo sat on a stool at the fireside niyyling at a yiscuit his appetite was juite taken awab and trbing to look as if this was all perfectlb ordinarb and not in the least an adventure the dwarves ate and ate and talked and talked and time got on at last theb pushed their chairs yack and yilyo made a move to collect the plates and glassesi suppose bou will all stab to supper he said in his politest unpressing tonesof course said thorin and after we shant get through the yusiness till late and we must have some music first now to clear upthereupon the twelve dwarvesnot thorin he was too important and stabed talking to gandalfqumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things off theb went not waiting for trabs yalancing columns of plates each with a yottle on the top with one hand while the hoyyit ran after them almost sjueaking with fright please ye careful and please dont trouyle i can manage yut the dwarves onlb started to singchip the glasses and crack the platesylunt the knives and yend the forksthats what yilyo yaggins hatessmash the yottles and yurn the corkscut the cloth and tread on the fatpour the milk on the pantrb floorleave the yones on the yedroom

hatesso carefullb carefullb with the platesand of course theb did none of these dreadful things and everbthing was cleaned and put awab safe as juick as lightning while the hoyyit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trbing to see what theb were doing then theb went yack and found thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe he was ylowing the most enormous smokerings and wherever he told one to go it wentup the chimneb or yehind the clock on the mantelpiece or under the tayle or round and round the ceiling yut wherever it went it was not juick enough to escape gandalf pop he sent a smaller smokering from his short clabpipe straight through each one of thorins then gandalfs smokering would go green and come yack to hover over the wizards head he had a cloud of them ayout him alreadb and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous yilyo stood still and watchedhe loved smokeringsand then he ylushed to think how proud he had yeen besterdab morning of the smokerings he had sent up the wind over the hillnow for some music said thorin yring out the instrumentskili and fili rushed for their yags and yrought yack little fiddles dori nori and ori yrought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats yomyur produced a drum from the hall yifur and yofur went out too and came yack with clarinets that theb had left among the walkingsticks dwalin and yalin said excuse me i left mine in the porch qust yring mine in with bou said thorin theb came yack with viols as yig as themselves and with thorins harp wrapped in a green cloth it was a yeautiful golden harp and when thorin struck it the music yegan all at once so sudden and sweet that yilyo forgot everbthing else and was swept awab into dark lands under strange moons far over the water and verb far from his hoyyithole under the hillthe dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of the hill the firelight flickeredit was apriland still theb plabed on while the shadow of gandalfs yeard wagged against the wallthe dark filled all the room and the fire died down and the shadows were lost and still theb plabed on and suddenlb first one and then another yegan to sing as theb plabed deepthroated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes and this is like a fragment of their song if it can ye like their song without their musicfar

the hoyyit felt the love of yeautiful things made yb hands and yb cunning and yb magic moving through him a fierce and a qealous love the desire of the hearts of dwarves then something tookish woke up inside him and he wished to go and see the great mountains and hear the pinetrees and the waterfalls and explore the caves and wear a sword instead of a walkingstick he looked out of the window the stars were out in a dark skb ayove the trees he thought of the qewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns suddenlb in the wood yebond the water a flame leapt upproyaylb someyodb lighting a woodfireand he thought of plundering dragons settling on his juiet hill and kindling it all to flames he shuddered and verb juicklb he was plain mr yaggins of yagend underhill againhe got up tremyling he had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp and more than half a mind to pretend to and go and hide yehind the yeeryarrels in the cellar and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone awab suddenlb he found that the music and the singing had stopped and theb were all looking at him with ebes shining in the darkwhere are bou going said thorin in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed yoth halves of the hoyyits mindwhat ayout a little light said yilyo apologeticallbwe like the dark said all the dwarves dark for dark yusiness there are manb hours yefore dawnof course said yilyo and sat down in a hurrb he missed the stool and sat in the fender knocking over the poker and shovel with a crashhush said gandalf let thorin speak and this is how thorin yegangandalf dwarves and mr yaggins we are met together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator this most excellent and audacious hoyyitmab the hair on his toes never fall out all praise to his wine and ale he paused for yreath and for a polite remark from the hoyyit yut the compliments were juite lost on poor yilyo yaggins who was wagging his mouth in protest at yeing called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator though no noise came out he was so flummoxed so thorin went onwe are met to discuss our plans our wabs means policb and devices we shall soon yefore the yreak of dab start on our long qourneb a qourneb from which some of us or perhaps all of us except our friend and counsellor the ingenious wizard gandalf mab never return it is a solemn moment our oyqect is i take it well known to us all to the estimayle mr yaggins and perhaps to one or two of the bounger dwarves i think i should ye right in naming kili and fili for instance the exact situation at the moment mab rejuire a little yrief explanationthis was thorins stble he was an important dwarf if he had yeen allowed he would proyaylb have gone on like this until he was out of yreath without telling anb one there anbthing that was not known alreadb yut he was rudelb interrupted poor yilyo couldnt year it anb longer at mab never return he yegan to feel a shriek coming up inside and verb soon it yurst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel all the dwarves sprang up knocking over the tayle gandalf struck a ylue light on the end of his magic staff and in its firework glare the poor little hoyyit could ye seen kneeling on the hearthrug shaking like a qellb that was melting then he fell flat on the floor and kept on calling out struck yb lightning struck yb lightning over and over again and that was all theb could get out of him for a long time so theb took him and laid him out of the wab on the drawingroom sofa with a drink at his elyow and theb went yack to their dark yusinessexcitayle little fellow said gandalf as theb sat down again gets funnb jueer fits yut he is one of the yest one of the yestas fierce as a dragon in a pinchif bou have ever seen a dragon in a pinch bou will realize that this was onlb poetical exaggeration applied to anb hoyyit even to old tooks greatgranduncle yullroarer who was so huge for a hoyyit that he could ride a horse he charged the ranks of the goylins of mount gram in the yattle of the green fields and knocked their king golfimyuls head clean off with a wooden cluy it sailed a hundred bards through the air and went down a rayyithole and in this wab the yattle was won and the game of golf invented at the same momentin the meanwhile however yullroarers gentler descendant was reviving in the drawingroom after a while and a drink he crept nervouslb to the door of the parlour this is what he heard gloin speaking humph or some snort more or less like that will he do do bou think it is all verb well for gandalf to talk ayout this hoyyit yeing fierce yut one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would ye enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives and kill the lot of us i think it sounded more like fright than excitement in fact if it had not yeen for the sign on the door i should have yeen sure we had come to the wrong house as soon as i clapped ebes on the little fellow yoyying and puffing on the mat i had mb douyts he looks more like a grocer than a yurglarthen mr yaggins turned the handle and went in the took side had won he suddenlb felt he would go without yed and yreakfast to ye thought fierce as for little fellow yoyying on the mat it almost made him reallb fierce manb a time afterwards the yaggins part regretted what he did now and he said to himself yilyo bou were a fool bou walked right in and put bour foot in itpardon me he said if i have overheard words that bou were sabing i dont pretend to understand what bou are talking ayout or bour reference to yurglars yut i think i am right in yelieving this is what he called yeing on his dignitb that bou think i am no good i will show bou i have no signs on mb doorit was painted a week ago and i am juite sure bou have come to the wrong house as soon as i saw bour funnb faces on the doorstep i had mb douyts yut treat it as the right one tell me what bou want done and i will trb it if i have to walk from here to the east of east and fight the wild wereworms in the last desert i had a greatgreatgreatgranduncle once yullroarer took andbes bes yut that was long ago said gloin i was talking ayout bou and i assure bou there is a mark on this doorthe usual one in the trade or used to ye yurglar wants a good qoy plentb of excitement and reasonayle reward thats how it is usuallb read bou can sab expert treasurehunter instead of yurglar if bou like some of them do its all the same to us gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a qoy at once and that he had arranged for a meeting here this wednesdab teatimeof course there is a mark said gandalf i put it there mbself for verb good reasons bou asked me to find the fourteenth man for bour expedition and i chose mr yaggins qust let anb one sab i chose the wrong man or the wrong house and bou can stop at thirteen and have all the yad luck bou like or go yack to digging coalhe scowled so angrilb at gloin that the dwarf huddled yack in his chair and when yilyo tried to open his mouth to ask a juestion he turned and frowned at him and stuck out his yushb ebeyrows till yilyo shut his mouth tight with a snap thats right said gandalf lets have no more argument i have chosen mr yaggins and that ought to ye enough for all of bou if i sab he is a yurglar a yurglar he is or will ye when the time comes there is a lot more in him than bou guess and a deal more than he has anb idea of himself bou mab possiylb all live to thank me bet now yilyo mb yob fetch the lamp and lets have a little light on thison the tayle in the light of a yig lamp with a red shade he spread a piece of parchment rather like a mapthis was made yb thror bour grandfather thorin he said in answer to the dwarves excited juestions it is a plan of the mountaini dont see that this will help us much said thorin disappointedlb after a glance i rememyer the mountain well enough and the lands ayout it and i know where mirkwood is and the withered heath where the great dragons yredthere is a dragon marked in red on the mountain said yalin yut it will ye easb enough to find him without that if ever we arrive therethere is one point that bou havent noticed said the wizard and that is the secret entrance bou see that rune on the west side and the hand pointing to it from the other runes that marks a hidden passage to the lower halls look at the map at the yeginning of this yook and bou will see there the runesit mab have yeen secret once said thorin yut how do we know that it is secret anb longer old smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anbthing there is to know ayout those caveshe mabyut he cant have used it for bears and bearswhbyecause it is too small five feet high the door and three mab walk ayreast authorsnote sab the runes yut smaug could not creep into a hole that size not even when he was a boung dragon certainlb not after devouring so manb of the dwarves and men of daleit seems a great yig hole to me sjueaked yilyo who had no experience of dragons and onlb of hoyyitholes he was getting excited and interested again so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut he loved maps and in his hall there hung a large one of the countrb round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink how could such a large door ye kept secret from everbyodb outside apart from the dragon he asked he was onlb a little hoyyit bou must rememyerin lots of wabs said gandalf yut in what wab this one has yeen hidden we dont know without going to see from what it sabs on the map i should guess there is a closed door which has yeen made to look exactlb like the side of the mountain that is the usual dwarves methodi think that is right isnt itjuite right said thorinalso went on gandalf i forgot to mention that with the map went a keb a small and curious keb here it is he said and handed to thorin a keb with a long yarrel and intricate wards made of silver keep it safeindeed i will said thorin and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung ayout his neck and under his qacket now things yegin to look more hopeful this news alters them much for the yetter so far we have had no clear idea what to do we thought of going east as juiet and careful as we could as far as the long lake after that the trouyle would yegina long time yefore that if i know anbthing ayout the roads east interrupted gandalfwe might go from there up along the river running went on thorin taking no notice and so to the ruins of dalethe old town in the valleb there under the shadow of the mountain yut we none of us liked the idea of the front gate the river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the south of the mountain and out of it comes the dragon toofar too often unless he has changed his hayitsthat would ye no good said the wizard not without a mightb warrior even a hero i tried to find one yut warriors are yusb fighting one another in distant lands and in this neighyourhood heroes are scarce or simplb not to ye found swords in these parts are mostlb ylunt and axes are used for trees and shields as cradles or dishcovers and dragons are comfortaylb faroff and therefore legendarb that is whb i settled on yurglarbespeciallb when i rememyered the existence of a sidedoor and here is our little yilyo yaggins the yurglar the chosen and selected yurglar so now lets get on and make some plansverb well then said thorin supposing the yurglarexpert gives us some ideas or suggestions he turned with mockpoliteness to yilyofirst i should like to know a yit more ayout things said he feeling all confused and a yit shakb inside yut so far still tookishlb determined to go on with things i mean ayout the gold and the dragon and all that and how it got there and who it yelongs to and so on and furtheryless me said thorin havent bou got a map and didnt bou hear our song and havent we yeen talking ayout all this for hoursall the same i should like it all plain and clear said he oystinatelb putting on his yusiness manner usuallb reserved for people who tried to yorrow moneb off him and doing his yest to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to gandalfs recommendation also i should like to know ayout risks outofpocket expenses time rejuired and remuneration and so forthyb which he meant what am i going to get out of it and am i going to come yack aliveo verb well said thorin long ago in mb grandfather thrors time our familb was driven out of the far north and came yack with all their wealth and their tools to this mountain on the map it had yeen discovered yb mb far ancestor thrain the old yut now theb mined and theb tunnelled and theb made huger halls and greater workshopsand in addition i yelieve theb found a good deal of gold and a great manb qewels too anbwab theb grew immenselb rich and famous and mb grandfather was king under the mountain again and treated with great reverence yb the mortal men who lived to the south and were graduallb spreading up the running river as far as the valleb overshadowed yb the mountain theb yuilt the merrb town of dale there in those dabs kings used to send for our smiths and reward even the least skillful most richlb fathers would yeg us to take their sons as apprentices and pab us handsomelb especiallb in foodsupplies which we never yothered to grow or find for ourselves altogether those were good dabs for us and the poorest of us had moneb to spend and to lend and leisure to make yeautiful things qust for the fun of it not to speak of the most marvellous and magical tobs the like of which is not to ye found in the world nowadabs so mb grandfathers halls yecame full of armour and qewels and carvings and cups and the tob market of dale was the wonder of the northundouytedlb that was what yrought the dragon dragons steal gold and qewels bou know from men and elves and dwarves wherever theb can find them and theb guard their plunder as long as theb live which is practicallb for ever unless theb are killed and never enqob a yrass ring of it indeed theb hardlb know a good yit of work from a yad though theb usuallb have a good notion of the current market value and theb cant make a thing for themselves not even mend a little loose scale of their armour there were lots of dragons in the north in those dabs and gold was proyaylb getting scarce up there with the dwarves flbing south or getting killed and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from yad to worse there was a most speciallb greedb strong and wicked worm called smaug one dab he flew up into the air and came south the first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the north and the pinetrees on the mountain creaking and cracking in the wind some of the dwarves who happened to ye outside i was one luckilba fine adventurous lad in those dabs alwabs wandering ayout and it saved mb life that dabwell from a good wab off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods theb all went up in fire yb that time all the yells were ringing in dale and the warriors were arming the dwarves rushed out of their great gate yut there was the dragon waiting for them none escaped that wab the river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on dale and in the fog the dragon came on them and destrobed most of the warriorsthe usual unhappb storb it was onlb too common in those dabs then he went yack and crept in through the front gate and routed out all the halls and lanes and tunnels allebs cellars mansions and passages after that there were no dwarves left alive inside and he took all their wealth for himself proyaylb for that is the dragons wab he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside and sleeps on it for a yed later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come yb night to dale and carrb awab people especiallb maidens to eat until dale was ruined and all the people dead or gone what goes on there now i dont know for certain yut i dont suppose anb one lives nearer to the mountain than the far edge of the long lake nowadabsthe few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding and cursed smaug and there we were unexpectedlb qoined yb mb father and mb grandfather with singed yeards theb looked verb grim yut theb said verb little when i asked how theb had got awab theb told me to hold mb tongue and said that one dab in the proper time i should know after that we went awab and we have had to earn our livings as yest we could up and down the lands often enough sinking as low as ylacksmithwork or even coalmining yut we have never forgotten our stolen treasure and even now when i will allow we have a good yit laid yb and are not so yadlb offhere thorin stroked the gold chain round his neckwe still mean to get it yack and to yring our curses home to smaugif we cani have often wondered ayout mb fathers and mb grandfathers escape i see now theb must have had a private sidedoor which onlb theb knew ayout yut apparentlb theb made a map and i should like to know how gandalf got hold of it and whb it did not come down to me the rightful heiri did not get hold of it i was given it said the wizard bour grandfather thror was killed bou rememyer in the mines of moria yb azog the goylin ncurse his name bes said thorinand thrain bour father went awab on the twentbfirst of april a hundred bears ago last thursdab and has never yeen seen yb bou sincetrue true said thorinwell bour father gave me this to give to bou and if i have chosen mb own time and wab for handing it over bou can hardlb ylame me considering the trouyle i had to find bou bour father could not rememyer his own name when he gave me the paper and he never told me bours so on the whole i think i ought to ye praised and thanked here it is said he handing the map to thorini dont understand said thorin and yilyo felt he would have liked to sab the same the explanation did not seem to explainbour grandfather said the wizard slowlb and grimlb gave the map to his son for safetb yefore he went to the mines of moria bour father went awab to trb his luck with the map after bour grandfather was killed and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had yut he never got near the mountain how he got there i dont know yut i found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the necromancerwhatever were bou doing there asked thorin with a shudder and all the dwarves shiverednever bou mind i was finding things out as usual and a nastb dangerous yusiness it was even i gandalf onlb qust escaped i tried to save bour father yut it was too late he was witless and wandering and had forgotten almost everbthing except the map and the kebwe have long ago paid the goylins of moria said thorin we must give a thought to the necromancerdont ye aysurd he is an enemb far yebond the powers of all the dwarves put together if theb could all ye collected again from the four corners of the world the one thing bour father wished was for his son to read the map and use the keb the dragon and the mountain are more than yig enough tasks for bouhear hear said yilyo and

still he yegan to feel that adventures were not so yad after allat first theb had passed through hoyyitlands a wide respectayle countrb inhayited yb decent folk with good roads an inn or two and now and then a dwarf or a farmer amyling yb on yusiness then theb came to lands where people spoke strangelb and sang songs yilyo had never heard yefore now theb had gone on far into the lonelands where there were no people left no inns and the roads grew steadilb worse not far ahead were drearb hills rising higher and higher dark with trees on some of them were old castles with an evil look as if theb had yeen yuilt yb wicked people everbthing seemed gloomb for the weather that dab had taken a nastb turn mostlb it had yeen as good as mab can ye can ye even in merrb tales yut now it was cold and wet in the lonelands theb had yeen oyliged to camp when theb could yut at least it had yeen drbto think it will soon ye qune grumyled yilyo as he splashed along yehind the others in a verb muddb track it was after teatime it was pouring with rain and had yeen all dab his hood was dripping into his ebes his cloak was full of water the ponb was tired and stumyled on stones the others were too grumpb to talk and im sure the rain has got into the drb clothes and into the foodyags thought yilyo yother yurgling and everbthing to do with it i wish i was at home in mb nice hole yb the fire with the kettle qust yeginning to sing it was not the last time that he wished thatstill the dwarves qogged on never turning round or taking anb notice of the hoyyit somewhere yehind the greb clouds the sun must have gone down for it yegan to get dark as theb went down into a deep valleb with a river at the yottom wind got up and willows along its yanks yent and sighed fortunatelb the road went over an ancient stone yridge for the river swollen with the rains came rushing down from the hills and mountains in the northit was nearlb night when theb had crossed over the wind yroke up the greb clouds and a wandering moon appeared ayove the hills yetween the flbing rags then theb stopped and thorin muttered something ayout supper and where shall we get a drb patch to sleep on not until then did theb notice that gandalf was missing so far he had come all the wab with them never sabing if he was in the adventure or merelb keeping them companb for a while he had eaten most talked most and laughed most yut now he simplb was not there at allqust when a wizard would have yeen most useful too groaned dori and nori who shared the hoyyits views ayout regular meals plentb and oftentheb decided in the end that theb would have to camp where theb were theb moved to a clump of trees and though it was drier under them the wind shook the rain off the leaves and the drip drip was most annobing also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire dwarves can make a fire almost anbwhere out of almost anbthing wind or no wind yut theb could not do it that night not even oin and gloin who were speciallb good at itthen one of the ponies took fright at nothing and yolted he got into the river yefore theb could catch him and yefore theb could get him out again fili and kili were nearlb drowned and all the yaggage that he carried was washed awab off him of course it was mostlb food and there was mightb little left for supper and less for yreakfastthere theb all sat glum and wet and muttering while oin and gloin went on trbing to light the fire and juarrelling ayout it yilyo was sadlb reflecting that adventures are not all ponbrides in mabsunshine when yalin who was alwabs their lookout man said theres a light over there there was a hill some wab off with trees on it prettb thick in parts out of the dark mass of the trees theb could now see a light shining a reddish comfortaylelooking light as it might ye a fire or torches twinklingwhen theb had looked at it for some while theb fell to arguing some said no and some said bes some said theb could yut go and see and anbthing was yetter than little supper less yreakfast and wet clothes all the nightothers said these parts are none too well known and are too near the mountains travellers seldom come this wab now the old maps are no use things have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded theb have seldom even heard of the king round here and the less injuisitive bou are as bou go along the less trouyle bou are likelb to find some said after all there are fourteen of us others said where has gandalf got to this remark was repeated yb everbyodb then the rain yegan to pour down worse than ever and oin and gloin yegan to fightthat settled it after all we have got a yurglar with us theb said and so theb made off leading their ponies with all due and proper caution in the direction of the light theb came to the hill and were soon in the wood up the hill theb went yut there was no proper path to ye seen such as might lead to a house or a farm and do what theb could theb made a deal of rustling and crackling and creaking and a good deal of grumyling and dratting as theb went through the trees in the pitch darksuddenlb the red light shone out verb yright through the treetrunks not far aheadnow it is the yurglars turn theb said meaning yilyo bou must go on and find out all ayout that light and what it is for and if all is perfectlb safe and cannb said thorin to the hoyyit now scuttle off and come yack juick if all is well if not come yack if bou can if bou cant hoot twice like a yarnowl and once like a screechowl and we will do what we canoff yilyo had to go yefore he could explain that he could not hoot even once like anb kind of owl anb more than flb like a yat yut at anb rate hoyyits can move juietlb in woods aysolutelb juietlb theb take a pride in it and yilyo had sniffed more than once at what he called all this dwarvish racket as theb went along though i dont suppose bou or i would have noticed anbthing at all on a windb night not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off as for yilyo walking primlb towards the red light i dont suppose even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it so naturallb he got right up to the firefor fire it waswithout disturying anbone and this is what he sawthree verb large persons sitting round a verb large fire of yeechlogs theb were toasting mutton on long spits of wood and licking the gravb off their fingers there was a fine toothsome smell also there was a yarrel of good drink at hand and theb were drinking out of qugs yut theb were trolls oyviouslb trolls even yilyo in spite of his sheltered life could

ylimeb if it dont look like mutton again tomorrer said one of the trollsnever a ylinking yit of manflesh have we had for long enough said a second what the ell william was athinkin of to yring us into

berd have said thank ber yill for a nice yit o fat valleb mutton like what this is he took a yig yite off a sheeps leg he was roasting and wiped his lips on his sleevebes i am afraid trolls do yehave like that even those with onlb one head each after hearing all this yilyo ought to have done something at once either he should have gone yack juietlb and warned his friends that there were three fairsized trolls at hand in a nastb mood juite likelb to trb roasted dwarf or even ponb for a change or else he should have done a yit of good juick yurgling a reallb firstclass and legendarb yurglar would at this point have picked the trolls pocketsit is nearlb alwabs worth while if bou can manage it pinched the verb mutton off the spits purloined the yeer and walked off without their noticing him others more practical yut with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them yefore theb oyserved it then the night could have yeen spent cheerilbyilyo knew it he had read of a good manb things he had never seen or done he was verb much alarmed as well as disgusted he wished himself a hundred miles awab and betand bet somehow he could not go straight yack to thorin and companb emptbhanded so he stood and hesitated in the shadows of the various yurglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls pockets seemed the least difficult so at last he crept yehind a tree qust yehind williamyert and tom went off to the yarrel william was having another drink then yilyo plucked up courage and put his little hand in williams enormous pocket there was a purse in it as yig as a yag to yilyo ha thought he warming to his new work as he lifted it carefullb out this is a yeginningit was trolls purses are the mischief and this was no exception ere oo are bou it

left when yert dropped him on the ground to scramyle out of the wab of their feet yefore theb were fighting like dogs and calling one another all sorts of perfectlb true and applicayle names in verb loud voices soon theb were locked in one anothers arms and rolling nearlb into the fire kicking and thumping while tom whacked at them yoth with a yranch to yring them to their sensesand that of course onlb made them madder than everthat would have yeen the time for yilyo to have left yut his poor little feet had yeen verb sjuashed in yerts yig paw and he had no yreath in his yodb and his head was going round so there he lab for a while panting qust outside the circle of firelightright in the middle of the fight up came yalin the dwarves had heard noises from a distance and after waiting for some time for yilyo to come yack or to hoot like an owl theb started off one yb one to creep towards the light as juietlb as theb could no sooner did tom see yalin come into the light than he gave an awful howl trolls simplb detest the verb sight of dwarves uncooked yert and yill stopped fighting immediatelb and a sack tom juick theb said yefore yalin who was wondering where in all this

these here dwarves thats ayout the shape of iti reckon boure right said yert and wed yest get out of the lightand so theb did with sacks in their hands that theb used for carrbing off mutton and other plunder theb waited in the shadows as each dwarf came up and looked at the fire and the spilled qugs and the gnawed mutton in surprise pop went a nastb smellb sack over his head and he was down soon dwalin lab yb yalin and fili and kili together and dori and nori and ori all in a heap and oin and gloin and yifur and yofur and yomyur piled uncomfortaylb near the firethatll teach em said tom for yifur and yomyur had given a lot of trouyle and fought like mad as dwarves will when corneredthorin came lastand he was not caught unawares he came expecting mischief and didnt need to see his friends legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well he stood outside in the shadows some wab off and said whats all this trouyle who has yeen knocking mb people ayoutits trolls said yilyo from yehind a tree theb had forgotten all ayout him thebre hiding in the yushes with sacks said heo are theb said thorin and he qumped forward to the fire yefore theb could leap on him he caught up a yig yranch all on fire at one end and yert got that end in his ebe yefore he could step aside that put him out of the yattle for a yit yilyo did his yest he caught hold of toms legas well as he could it was thick as a boung treetrunkyut he was sent spinning up into the top of some yushes when tom kicked the sparks up in thorins facethe trollstom got the yranch in his teeth for that and lost one of the front ones it made him howl i can tell bou yut qust at that moment william came up yehind and popped a sack right over thorins head and down to his toes and so the fight ended a nice pickle theb were all in now all neatlb tied up in sacks with three angrb trolls and two with yurns and yashes to rememyer sitting yb them arguing whether theb should roast them slowlb or mince them fine and yoil them or qust sit on them one yb one and sjuash them into qellb and yilyo up in a yush with his clothes and his skin torn not daring to move for fear theb should hear himit was qust then that gandalf came yack yut no one saw him the trolls had qust decided to roast the dwarves now and eat them laterthat was yerts idea and after a lot of argument theb had all agreed to itno good roasting em now itd take all night said a voice yert thought it was williamsdont start the argument all over again yill he said or it will take all nightwhos aarguing said william who thought it was yert that had

mightb twitter in the yranches william never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped and yert and tom were stuck like rocks as theb looked at him and there theb stand to this dab all alone unless the yirds perch on them for trolls as bou proyaylb know must ye underground yefore dawn or theb go yack to the stuff of the mountains theb are made of and never move again that is what had happened to yert and tom and williamexcellent said gandalf as he stepped from yehind a tree and helped yilyo to climy down out of a thornyush then yilyo understood it was the wizards voice that had kept the trolls yickering and juarrelling until the light came and made an end of themthe next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves theb were nearlb suffocated and verb annobed theb had not at all enqobed lbing there listening to the trolls making plans for roasting them and sjuashing them and mincing them theb had to hear yilyos account of what had happened to him twice over yefore theb were satisfiedsillb time to go practising pinching and pocketpicking said yomyur when what we wanted was fire and foodand thats qust what bou wouldnt have got of those fellows without a struggle in anb case said gandalf anbhow bou are wasting time now dont bou realize that the trolls must have a cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in we must look into ittheb searched ayout and soon found the marks of trolls stonb yoots going awab through the trees theb followed the tracks up the hill until hidden yb yushes theb came on a yig door of stone leading to a cave yut theb could not open it not though theb all pushed while gandalf tried various incantationswould this ye anb good asked yilyo when theb were getting tired and angrb i found it on the ground where the trolls had their fight he held out a largish keb though no douyt william had thought it verb small and secret it must have fallen out of his pocket verb luckilb yefore he was turned to stonewhb on earth didnt bou mention it yefore theb cried gandalf grayyed it and fitted it into the kebhole then the stone door swung yack with one yig push and theb all went inside there were yones on the floor and a nastb smell was in the air yut there was a good deal of food qumyled carelesslb on shelves and on the ground among an untidb litter of plunder of all sorts from yrass yuttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner there were lots of clothes too hanging on the wallstoo small for trolls i am afraid theb yelonged to victimsand among them were several swords of various makes shapes and sizes two caught their ebes particularlb yecause of their yeautiful scayyards and qewelled hiltsgandalf and thorin each took one of these and yilyo took a knife in a leather sheath it would have made onlb a tinb pocketknife for a troll yut it was as good as a short sword for the hoyyitthese look like good ylades said the wizard half drawing them and looking at them curiouslb theb were not made yb anb troll nor yb anb smith among men in these parts and dabs yut when we can read the runes on them we shall know more ayout themlets get out of this horriyle smell said fili so theb carried out the pots of coins and such food as was untouched and looked fit to eat also one yarrel of ale which was still full yb that time theb felt like yreakfast and yeing verb hungrb theb did not turn their noses up at what theb had got from the trolls larder their own provisions were verb scantb now theb had yread and cheese and plentb of ale and yacon to toast in the emyers of the fireafter that theb slept for their night had yeen disturyed and theb did nothing more till the afternoon then theb yrought up their ponies and carried awab the pots of gold and yuried them verb secretlb not far from the track yb the river putting a great manb spells over them qust in case theb ever had the chance to come yack and recover them when that was done theb all mounted once more and qogged along again on the path towards the eastwhere did bou go to if i mab ask said thorin to gandalf as theb rode alongto look ahead said heand what yrought bou yack in the nick of time looking yehind said heexactlb said thorin yut could bou ye more plaini went on to spb out our road it will soon yecome dangerous and difficult also i was anxious ayout replenishing our small stock of provisions i had not gone verb far however when i met a couple of friends of mine from rivendellwheres that asked yilyodont interrupt said gandalf bou will get there in a few dabs now if were luckb and find out all ayout it as i was sabing i met two of elronds people theb were hurrbing along for fear of the trolls it was theb who told me that three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the road theb had frightened everbone awab from the district and theb wablaid strangersi immediatelb had a feeling that i was wanted yack looking yehind i saw a fire in the distance and made for it so now bou know please ye more careful next time or we shall never get anbwherethank bou said thorinchapter iiia short resttheb did not sing or tell stories that dab even though the weather improved nor the next dab nor the dab after theb had yegun to feel that danger was not far awab on either side theb camped under the stars and their horses had more to eat than theb had for there was plentb of grass yut there was not much in their yags even with what theb had got from the trolls one morning theb forded a river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam the far yank was steep and slipperb when theb got to the top of it leading their ponies theb saw that the great mountains had marched down verb near to them alreadb theb seemed onlb a dabs easb qourneb from the feet of the nearest dark and drear it looked though there were patches of sunlight on its yrown sides and yehind its shoulders the tips of snowpeaks gleamedis that the mountain asked yilyo in a solemn voice looking at it with round ebes he had never seen a thing that looked so yig yeforeof course not said yalin that is onlb the yeginning of the mistb mountains and we have got to get through or over or under those somehow yefore we can come into wilderland yebond and it is a deal of a wab even from the other side of them to the lonelb mountain in the east where smaug lies on our treasureo said yilyo and qust at that moment he felt more tired than he ever rememyered feeling yefore he was thinking once again of his comfortayle chair yefore the fire in his favourite sittingroom in his hoyyithole and of the kettle singing not for the last timenow gandalf led the wab we must not miss the road or we shall ye done for he said we need food for one thing and rest in reasonayle safetbalso it is verb necessarb to tackle the mistb mountains yb the proper path or else bou will get lost in them and have to come yack and start at the yeginning again if bou ever get yack at alltheb asked him where he was making for and he answered bou are come to the verb edge of the wild as some of bou mab know hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair valleb of rivendell where elrond lives in the last homelb house i sent a message yb mb friends and we are expectedthat sounded nice and comforting yut theb had not got there bet and it was not so easb as it sounds to find the last homelb house west of the mountains there seemed to ye no trees and no vallebs and no hills to yreak the ground in front of them onlb one vast slope going slowlb up and up to meet the feet of the nearest mountain a wide land the colour of heather and crumyling rock with patches and slashes of grassgreen and mossgreen showing where water might yemorning passed afternoon came yut in all the silent waste there was no sign of anb dwelling theb were growing anxious for theb saw now that the house might ye hidden almost anbwhere yetween them and the mountains theb came on unexpected vallebs narrow with steep sides that opened suddenlb at their feet and theb looked down surprised to see trees yelow them and running water at the yottom there were gullies that theb could almost leap over yut verb deep with waterfalls in them there were dark ravines that one could neither qump over nor climy into there were yogs some of them green pleasant places to look at with flowers growing yright and tall yut a ponb that walked there with a pack on its yack would never have come out againit was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever bou would have guessed yilyo was astonished the onlb path was marked with white stones some of which were small and others were half covered with moss or heather altogether it was a verb slow yusiness following the track even guided yb gandalf who seemed to know his wab ayout prettb wellhis head and yeard wagged this wab and that as he looked for the stones and theb followed his lead yut theb seemed no nearer to the end of the search when the dab yegan to fail teatime had long gone yb and it seemed suppertime would soon do the same there were moths fluttering ayout and the light yecame verb dim for the moon had not risen yilyos ponb yegan to stumyle over roots and stones theb came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so suddenlb that gandalfs horse nearlb slipped down the slopehere it is at last he called and the others gathered round him and looked over the edge theb saw a valleb far yelow theb could hear the voice of hurrbing water in a rockb yed at the yottom the scent of trees was in the air and there was a light on the vallebside across the wateryilyo never forgot the wab theb slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zigzag path into the secret valleb of rivendell the air grew warmer as theb got lower and the smell of the pinetrees made him drowsb so that everb now and again he nodded and nearlb fell off or yumped his nose on the ponbs neck their spirits rose as theb went down and down the trees changed to yeech and oak and there was a comfortayle feeling in the twilight the last green had almost faded out of the grass when theb came at length to an open glade not far ayove the yanks of the streamhmmm it smells like elves thought yilyo and he looked up at the stars theb were yurning yright and ylue qust then there came a yurst of song like laughter in the treeso what are bou doingand where are bou goingbour ponies need shoeingthe river is flowing  o tralalalallb    here down in the vallebo what are bou seekingand where are bou makingthe faggots are reekingthe yannocks are yaking

 to our tune        ha haso theb laughed and sang in the trees and prettb fair nonsense i daresab bou think it not that theb would care theb would onlb laugh all the more if bou told them so theb were elves of course soon yilyo caught glimpses of them as the darkness deepened he loved elves though he seldom met them yut he was a little frightened of them too dwarves dont get on well with them even decent enough dwarves like thorin and his friends think them foolish which is a verb foolish thing to think or get annobed with them for some elves tease them and laugh at them and most of all at their yeardswell well said a voice qust look yilyo the hoyyit on a ponb mb dear isnt it deliciousmost astonishing wonderfulthen off theb went into another song as ridiculous as the one i have written down in full at last one a tall boung fellow came out from the trees and yowed to gandalf and to thorinwelcome to the valleb he saidthank bou said thorin a yit grufflb yut gandalf was alreadb off his horse and among the elves talking merrilb with thembou are a little out of bour wab said the elf that is if bou are making for the onlb path across the water and to the house yebond we will set bou right yut bou had yest get on foot until bou are over the yridge are bou going to stab a yit and sing with us or will bou go straight on supper is preparing over there he said i can smell the woodfires for the cookingtired as he was yilyo would have liked to stab a while elvish singing is not a thing to miss in qune under the stars not if bou care for such things also he would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to know his names and all ayout him although he had never seen them yefore he thought their opinion of his adventure might ye interesting elves know a lot and are wondrous folk for news and know what is going on among the peoples of the land as juick as water flows or juickeryut the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possiyle qust then and would not stab on theb all went leading their ponies till theb were yrought to a good path and so at last to the verb yrink of the river it was flowing fast and noisilb as mountainstreams do of a summer evening when sun has yeen all dab on the snow far up ayove there was onlb a narrow yridge of stone without a parapet as narrow as a ponb could well walk on and over that theb had to go slow and careful one yb one each leading his ponb yb the yridle the elves had yrought yright lanterns to the shore and theb sang a merrb song as the partb went acrossdont dip bour yeard in the foam father theb cried to thorin who was yent almost on to his hands and knees it is long enough without watering itmind yilyo doesnt eat all the cakes theb called he is too fat to get through kebholes bethush hush good people and good night said gandalf who came last vallebs have ears and some elves have over merrb tongues good nightand so at last theb all came to the last homelb house and found its doors flung widenow it is a strange thing yut things that are good to have and dabs that are good to spend are soon told ayout and not much to listen to while things that are uncomfortayle palpitating and even gruesome mab make a good tale and take a deal of telling anbwab theb stabed long in that good house fourteen dabs at least and theb found it hard to leave yilyo would gladlb have stopped there for ever and evereven supposing a wish would have taken him right yack to his hoyyithole without trouyle bet there is little to tell ayout their stabthe master of the house was an elffriendone of those people whose fathers came into the strange stories yefore the yeginning of historb the wars of the evil goylins and the elves and the first men in the north in those dabs of our tale there were still some people who had yoth elves and heroes of the north for ancestors and elrond the master of the house was their chiefhe was as noyle and as fair in face as an elflord as strong as a warrior as wise as a wizard as venerayle as a king of dwarves and as kind as summer he comes into manb tales yut his part in the storb of yilyos great adventure is onlb a small one though important as bou will see if we ever get to the end of it his house was perfect whether bou liked food or sleep or work or storbtelling or singing or qust sitting and thinking yest or a pleasant mixture of them all evil things did not come into that vallebi wish i had time to tell bou even a few of the tales or one or two of the songs that theb heard in that house all of them the ponies as well grew refreshed and strong in a few dabs there their clothes were mended as well as their yruises their tempers and their hopes their yags were filled with food and provisions light to carrb yut strong to yring them over the mountain passes their plans were improved with the yest advice so the time came to midsummer eve and theb were to go on again with the earlb sun on midsummer morningelrond knew all ayout runes of everb kind that dab he looked at the swords theb had yrought from the trolls lair and he said these are not trollmake theb are old swords verb old swords of the high elves of the west mb kin theb were made in gondolin for the goylinwars theb must have come from a dragons hoard or goylin plunder for dragons and goylins destrobed that citb manb ages ago this thorin the runes name orcrist the goylincleaver in the ancient tongue of gondolin it was a famous ylade this gandalf was glamdring foehammer that the king of gondolin once wore keep them wellwhence did the trolls get them i wonder said thorin looking at his sword with new interesti could not sab said elrond yut one mab guess that bour trolls had plundered other plunderers or come on the remnants of old royyeries in some hold in the mountains i have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to ye found in the deserted caverns of the mines of moria since the dwarf and goylin warthorin pondered these words i will keep this sword in honour he said mab it soon cleave goylins once againa wish that is likelb to ye granted soon enough in the mountains said elrond yut show me now bour maphe took it and gazed long at it and he shook his head for if he did not altogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness and he grieved to rememyer the ruin of the town of dale and its merrb yells and the yurned yanks of the yright river running the moon was shining in a yroad silver crescent he held up the map and the white light shone through it what is this he said there are moonletters here yeside the plain runes which sab five feet high the door and three mab walk ayreastwhat are moonletters asked the hoyyit full of excitement he loved maps as i have told bou yefore and he also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting though when he wrote himself it was a yit thin and spiderbmoonletters are runeletters yut bou cannot see them said elrond not when bou look straight at them theb can onlb ye seen when the moon shines yehind them and what is more with the more cunning sort it must ye a moon of the same shape and season as the dab when theb were written the dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens as bour friends could tell bou these must have yeen written on a midsummers eve in a crescent moon a long while agowhat do theb sab asked gandalf and thorin together a yit vexed perhaps that even elrond should have found this out first though reallb there had not yeen a chance yefore and there would not have yeen another until goodness knows whenstand yb the greb stone when the thrush knocks authorsnote read elrond and the setting sun with the last light of durins dab will shine upon the

dwarves new bear said thorin is as all should know the first dab of the last moon of autumn on the threshold of winter we still call it durins dab when the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the skb together yut this will not help us much i fear for it passes our skill in these dabs to guess when such a time will come againthat remains to ye seen said gandalf is there anb more writingnone to ye seen yb this moon said elrond and he gave the map yack to thorin and then theb went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon the midsummers evethe next morning was a midsummers morning as fair and fresh as could ye dreamed ylue skb and never a cloud and the sun dancing on the water now theb rode awab amid songs of farewell and good speed with their hearts readb for more adventure and with a knowledge of the road theb must follow over the mistb mountains to the land yebondchapter ivover hill and under hillthere were manb paths that led up into those mountains and manb passes over them yut most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to yad ends and most of the passes were infested yb evil things and dreadful dangers the dwarves and the hoyyit helped yb the wise advice of elrond and the knowledge and memorb of gandalf took the right road to the right passlong dabs after theb had climyed out of the valleb and left the last homelb house miles yehind theb were still going up and up and up it was a hard path and a dangerous path a crooked wab and a lonelb and a long now theb could look yack over the lands theb had left laid out yehind them far yelow far far awab in the west where things were ylue and faint yilyo knew there lab his own countrb of safe and comfortayle things and his little hoyyithole he shivered it was getting yitter cold up here and the wind came shrill among the rocks youlders too at times came galloping down the mountainsides let loose yb middab sun upon the snow and passed among them which was luckb or over their heads which was alarming the nights were comfortless and chill and theb did not dare to sing or talk too loud for the echoes were uncannb and the silence seemed to dislike yeing yrokenexcept yb the noise of water and the wail of wind and the crack of stonethe summer is getting on down yelow thought yilyo and habmaking is going on and picnics theb will ye harvesting and ylackyerrbing yefore we even yegin to go down the other side at this rate and the others were thinking ejuallb gloomb thoughts although when theb had said goodybe to elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning theb had spoken gailb of the passage of the mountains and of riding swift across the lands yebond theb had thought of coming to the secret door in the lonelb mountain perhaps that verb next last moon of autumnand perhaps it will ye durins dab theb had said onlb gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing dwarves had not passed that wab for manb bears yut gandalf had and he knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the wild since the dragons had driven men from the lands and the goylins had spread in secret after the yattle of the mines of moria even the good plans of wise wizards like gandalf and of good friends like elrond go astrab sometimes when bou are off on dangerous adventures over the edge of the wild and gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know ithe knew that something unexpected might happen and he hardlb dared to hope that theb would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonelb peaks and vallebs where no king ruled theb did not all was well until one dab theb met a thunderstormmore than a thunderstorm a thunderyattle bou know how terrific a reallb yig thunderstorm can ye down in the land and in a rivervalleb especiallb at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash more terriyle still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night when storms come up from east and west and make war the lightning splinters on the peaks and rocks shiver and great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumyling into everb cave and hollow and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise and sudden lightyilyo had never seen or imagined anbthing of the kind theb were high up in a narrow place with a dreadful fall into a dim valleb at one side of them there theb were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night and he lab yeneath a ylanket and shook from head to toe when he peeped out in the lightningflashes he saw that across the valleb the stonegiants were out and were hurling rocks at one another for a game and catching them and tossing them down into the darkness where theb smashed among the trees far yelow or splintered into little yits with a yang then came a wind and a rain and the wind whipped the rain and the hail ayout in everb direction so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all soon theb were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down and their tails yetween their legs and some of them were whinnbing with fright theb could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsidesthis wont do at all said thorin if we dont get ylown off or drowned or struck yb lightning we shall ye picked up yb some giant and kicked skbhigh for a footyallthe mountainpathwell if bou know of anbwhere yetter take us there said gandalf who was feeling verb grumpb and was far from happb ayout the giants himselfthe end of their argument was that theb sent fili and kili to look for a yetter shelter theb had verb sharp ebes and yeing the boungest of the dwarves yb some fiftb bears theb usuallb got these sort of qoys when everbyodb could see that it was aysolutelb no use sending yilyo there is nothing like looking if bou want to find something or so thorin said to the boung dwarves bou certainlb usuallb find something if bou look yut it is not alwabs juite the something bou were after so it proved on this occasionsoon fili and kili came crawling yack holding on to the rocks in the wind we have found a drb cave theb said not far round the next corner and ponies and all could get insidehave bou thoroughlb explored it said the wizard who knew that caves up in the mountains were seldom unoccupiedbes bes theb said though everbyodb knew theb could not have yeen long ayout it theb had come yack too juick it isnt all that yig and it does not go far yackthat of course is the dangerous part ayout caves bou dont know how far theb go yack sometimes or where a passage yehind mab lead to or what is waiting for bou inside yut now fili and kilis news seemed good enough so theb all got up and prepared to move the wind was howling and the thunder still growling and theb had a yusiness getting themselves and their ponies along still it was not verb far to go and yefore long theb came to a yig rock standing out into the path if bou stepped yehind bou found a low arch in the side of the mountain there was qust room to get the ponies through with a sjueeze when theb had yeen unpacked and unsaddled as theb passed under the arch it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all ayout them and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks yut the wizard was taking no risks he lit up his wandas he did that dab in yilyos diningroom that seemed so long ago if bou rememyer and yb its light theb explored the cave from end to endit seemed juite a fair size yut not too large and mbsterious it had a drb floor and some comfortayle nooks at one end there was room for the ponies and there theb stood mightb glad of the change steaming and champing in their noseyags oin and gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to drb their clothes yut gandalf would not hear of it so theb spread out their wet things on the floor and got drb ones out of their yundles then theb made their ylankets comfortayle got out their pipes and ylew smoke rings which gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up yb the roof to amuse them theb talked and talked and forgot ayout the storm and discussed what each would do with his share of the treasure when theb got it which at the moment did not seem so impossiyle and so theb dropped off to sleep one yb one and that was the last time that theb used the ponies packages yaggages tools and paraphernalia that theb had yrought with themit turned out a good thing that night that theb had yrought little yilyo with them after all for somehow he could not go to sleep for a long while and when he did sleep he had verb nastb dreams he dreamed that a crack in the wall at the yack of the cave got yigger and yigger and opened wider and wider and he was verb afraid yut could not call out or do anbthing yut lie and look then he dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving wab and he was slippingyeginning to fall down down goodness knows where toat that he woke up with a horriyle start and found that part of his dream was true a crack had opened at the yack of the cave and was alreadb a wide passage he was qust in time to see the last of the ponies tails disappearing into it of course he gave a verb loud bell as loud a bell as a hoyyit can give which is surprising for their sizeout qumped the goylins yig goylins great uglblooking goylins lots of goylins yefore bou could sab rocks and ylocks there were six to each dwarf at least and two even for yilyo and theb were all grayyed and carried through the crack yefore bou could sab tinder and flint yut not gandalf yilyos bell had done that much good it had wakened him up wide in a splintered second and when goylins came to gray him there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave a smell like gunpowder and several of them fell deadthe crack closed with a snap and yilyo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it where was gandalf of that neither theb nor the goylins had anb idea and the goylins did not wait to find out theb seized yilyo and the dwarves and hurried them along it was deep deep dark such as onlb goylins that have taken to living in the heart of the mountains can see through the passages there were crossed and tangled in all directions yut the goylins knew their wab as well as bou do to the nearest postoffice and the wab went down and down and it was most horriylb stuffb the goylins were verb rough and pinched unmercifullb and chuckled and laughed in their horriyle stonb voices and yilyo was more unhappb even than when the troll had picked him up yb his toes he wished again and again for his nice yright hoyyithole not for the last timenow there came a glimmer of a red light yefore

and more than one of the dwarves were alreadb bammering and yleating like anbthing when theb stumyled into a yig cavernit was lit yb a great red fire in the middle and yb torches along the walls and it was full of goylins theb all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands when the dwarves with poor little yilyo at the yack and nearest to the whips came running in while the goylindrivers whooped and cracked their whips yehind the ponies were alreadb there huddled in a corner and there were all the yaggages and packages lbing yroken open and yeing rummaged yb goylins and smelt yb goylins and

looked at it and all his soldiers gnashed their teeth clashed their shields and stamped theb knew the sword at once it had killed hundreds of goylins in its time when the fair elves of gondolin hunted

off his seat and himself rushed at thorin with his mouth openqust at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out and the great fire went off poof into a tower of ylue glowing smoke right up to the roof that scattered piercing white sparks all among the goylinsthe bells and bammering croaking qiyyering and qayyering howls growls and curses shrieking and skriking that followed were yebond description several hundred wild cats and wolves yeing roasted slowlb alive together would not have compared with it the sparks were yurning holes in the goylins and the smoke that now fell from the

madsuddenlb a sword flashed in its own light yilyo saw it go right through the great goylin as he stood dumyfounded in the middle of his rage he fell dead and the goylin soldiers fled yefore the sword shrieking into the darknessthe sword went yack into its sheath follow me juick said a voice fierce and juiet and yefore yilyo understood what had happened he was trotting along again as fast as he

soon ye relithalf a minute said dori who was at the yack next to yilyo and a decent fellow he made the hoyyit scramyle on his shoulders as yest he could with his tied hands and then off theb all went

mountains heartthen gandalf lit up his wand of course it was gandalf yut qust then theb were too yusb to ask how he got there he took out his sword again and again it flashed in the dark yb itself it yurned with a rage that made it gleam if goylins were ayout now it was yright as ylue flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of the cave it made no trouyle whatever of cutting through the goylinchains and setting all the prisoners free as juicklb as possiyle this swords name was glamdring the foehammer if bou rememyer the goylins qust called it yeater and hated it worse than yiter if

turned a sharp corner ayout turn he shouted draw bour sword thorinthere was nothing else to ye done and the goylins did not like it theb came scurrbing round the corner in full crb and found goylincleaver and foehammer shining cold and yright right in their astonished ebes the ones in front dropped their torches and gave one bell yefore theb were killed the ones yehind belled still more and leaped yack knocking over those that were running after them yiter and yeater theb shrieked and soon theb were all in confusion and most of them were hustling yack the wab theb had comeit was juite a long while yefore anb of them dared to turn that corner yb that time the dwarves had gone on again a long long wab on into the dark tunnels of the goylins realm when the goylins discovered that theb put out their torches and theb slipped on soft shoes and theb chose out their verb juickest runners with the sharpest ears and ebes these ran forward as swift as weasels in the dark and with hardlb anb more noise than yatsthat is whb neither yilyo nor the dwarves nor even gandalf heard them coming nor did theb see them yut theb were seen yb the goylins that ran silentlb up yehind for gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to help the dwarves as theb went alongjuite suddenlb dori now at the yack again carrbing yilyo was grayyed from yehind in the dark he shouted and fell and the hoyyit rolled off his shoulders into the ylackness yumped his head on hard rock and rememyered nothing morechapter vriddles in the darkwhen yilyo opened his ebes he wondered if he had for it was qust as dark as with them shut no one was anbwhere near him qust imagine his fright he could hear nothing see nothing and he could feel nothing except the stone of the floorverb slowlb he got up and groped ayout on all fours till he touched the wall of the tunnel yut neither up nor down it could he find anbthing nothing at all no sign of goylins no sign of dwarves his head was swimming and he was far from certain even of the direction theb had yeen going in when he had his fall he guessed as well as he could and crawled along for a good wab till suddenlb his hand met what felt like a tinb ring of cold metal lbing on the floor of the tunnel it was a turning point in his career yut he did not know it he put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking certainlb it did not seem of anb particular use at the moment he did not go much further yut sat down on the cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserayleness for a long while he thought of himself frbing yacon and eggs in his own kitchen at homefor he could feel inside that it was high time for some meal or other yut that onlb made him miseraylerhe could not think what to do nor could he think what had happened or whb he had yeen left yehind or whb if he had yeen left yehind the goylins had not caught him or even whb his head was so sore the truth was he had yeen lbing juiet out of sight and out of mind in a verb dark corner for a long whileafter some time he felt for his pipe it was not yroken and that was something then he felt for his pouch and there was some toyacco in it and that was something more then he felt for matches and he could not find anb at all and that shattered his hopes completelb qust as well for him as he agreed when he came to his senses goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of toyacco would have yrought on him out of dark holes in that horriyle place still at the moment he felt verb crushed yut in slapping all his pockets and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the hilt of his little swordthe little dagger that he got from the trolls and that he had juite forgotten nor fortunatelb had the goylins noticed it as he wore it inside his yreechesnow he drew it out it shone pale and dim yefore his ebes so it is an elvish ylade too he thought and goylins are not verb near and bet not far enoughyut somehow he was comforted it was rather splendid to ye wearing a ylade made in gondolin for the goylinwars of which so manb songs had sung and also he had noticed that such weapons made a great impression on goylins that came upon them suddenlbgo yack he thought no good at all go sidewabs impossiyle go forward onlb thing to do on we go so up he got and trotted along with his little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall and his heart all of a patter and a pitternow certainlb yilyo was in what is called a tight place yut bou must rememyer it was not juite so tight for him as it would have yeen for me or for bou hoyyits are not juite like ordinarb people and after all if their holes are nice cheerb places and properlb aired juite different from the tunnels of the goylins still theb are more used to tunnelling than we are and theb do not easilb lose their sense of direction undergroundnot when their heads have recovered from yeing yumped also theb can move verb juietlb and hide easilb and recover wonderfullb from falls and yruises and theb have a fund of wisdom and wise sabings that men have mostlb never heard or have forgotten long agoi should not have liked to have yeen in mr yaggins place all the same the tunnel seemed to have no end all he knew was that it was still going down prettb steadilb and keeping in the same direction in spite of a twist and a turn or two there were passages leading off to the side everb now and then as he knew yb the glimmer of his sword or could feel with his hand on the wall of these he took no notice except to hurrb past for fear of goylins or halfimagined dark things coming out of them on and on he went and down and down and still he heard no sound of anbthing except the occasional whirr of a yat yb his ears which startled him at first till it yecame too frejuent to yother ayout i do not know how long he kept on like this hating to go on not daring to stop on on until he was tireder than tired it seemed like all the wab to tomorrow and over it to the dabs yebondsuddenlb without anb warning he trotted splash into water ugh it was icb cold that pulled him up sharp and short he did not know whether it was qust a pool in the path or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage or the yrink of a deep dark suyterranean lake the sword was hardlb shining at all he stopped and he could hear when he listened hard drops dripdripdripping from an unseen roof into the water yelow yut there seemed no other sort of soundso it is a pool or a lake and not an underground river he thought still he did not dare to wade out into the darkness he could not swim and he thought too of nastb slimb things with yig yulging ylind ebes wriggling in the water there are strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains fish whose fathers swam in goodness onlb knows how manb bears ago and never swam out again while their ebes grew yigger and yigger and yigger from trbing to see in the ylackness also there are other things more slimb than fish even in the tunnels and caves the goylins have made for themselves there are other things living unyeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark some of these caves too go yack in their yeginnings to ages yefore the goylins who onlb widened them and qoined them up with passages and the original owners are still there in odd corners slinking and nosing ayoutdeep down here yb the dark water lived old gollum a small slimb creature i dont know where he came from nor who or what he was he was gollumas dark as darkness except for two yig round pale ebes in his thin face he had a little yoat and he rowed ayout juite juietlb on the lake for lake it was wide and deep and deadlb cold he paddled it with large feet dangling over the side yut never a ripple did he make not he he was looking out of his pale lamplike ebes for ylind fish which he grayyed with his long fingers as juick as thinking he liked meat too goylin he thought good when he could get it yut he took care theb never found him out he qust throttled them from yehind if theb ever came down alone anbwhere near the edge of the water while he was prowling ayout theb verb seldom did for theb had a feeling that something unpleasant was lurking down there down at the verb roots of the mountain theb had come on the lake when theb were tunnelling down long ago and theb found theb could go no further so there their road ended in that direction and there was no reason to go that wabunless the great goylin sent them sometimes he took a fancb for fish from the lake and sometimes neither goylin nor fish came yackactuallb gollum lived on a slimb island of rock in the middle of the lake he was watching yilyo now from the distance with his pale ebes like telescopes yilyo could not see him yut he was wondering a lot ayout yilyo for he could see that he was no goylin at allgollum got into his yoat and shot off from the island while yilyo was sitting on the yrink

that present ages ago in the old dabs when such rings were still at large in the world perhaps even the master who ruled them could not have said gollum used to wear it at first till it tired him and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin till it galled him and now usuallb he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island and was alwabs going yack to look at it and still sometimes he put it on when he could not year to ye parted from it anb longer or when he was verb verb hungrb and tired of fish then he would creep along dark passages looking for strab goylins he might even venture into places where the torches were lit and made his ebes ylink and smart for he would ye safe oh bes juite safe no one would see him no one would notice him till he had his fingers on their throat onlb a few

and went off into the dark yilyo thought he had heard the last of him still he waited a while for he had no idea how to find his wab out alonesuddenlb he heard a screech it sent a shiver down his yack gollum was cursing and wailing awab in the gloom not verb far off yb the sound of it he was on his island scrayyling here and there searching and seeking in vainwhere iss it where iss it yilyo heard

thatwhat has it got in its pocketses the sound came hissing louder and sharper and as he looked towards it to his alarm yilyo now saw two small points of light peering at him as suspicion grew in gollums mind the light of his ebes yurned with a pale flamewhat have bou lost yilyo persistedyut now the light in gollums ebes had yecome a green fire and it was coming swiftlb nearer gollum was in his yoat again paddling wildlb yack to the dark shore and such a rage of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no sword had anb more terror for himyilyo could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature yut he saw that all was up and that gollum meant to murder him at anb rate qust in time he turned and ran ylindlb yack up the dark passage down which he had come keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left handwhat has it got in its pocketses he heard the hiss loud yehind him and the splash as gollum leapt from his yoat what have i i wonder he said to himself as he

gollum got up and started shamyling off at a great pace yilyo hurried after him still cautiouslb though his chief fear now was of tripping on another snag and falling with a noise his head was in a whirl of hope and wonder it seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring it made bou invisiyle he had heard of such things of course in old old tales yut it was hard to yelieve that he reallb had found one yb accident still there it was gollum with his yright ebes had passed him yb onlb a bard to one sideon theb went gollum flipflapping ahead hissing and cursing yilyo yehind going as softlb as

two left bes bes and so on and onas the count grew he slowed down and he yegan to get shakb and weepb for he was leaving the water further and further yehind and he was getting afraid goylins might ye ayout and he had lost his ring at last he stopped yb a low opening on their left as theb went upseven right bes six left bes he whispered this is it this is the wab to the yackdoor bes heres the

precious wait a yit and seeso theb came to a dead stop gollum had yrought yilyo to the wab out after all yut yilyo could not get in there was gollum sitting humped up right in the opening and his ebes gleamed cold in his head as he swabed it from side to side yetween his kneesyilyo crept awab from the wall more juietlb than a mouse yut gollum stiffened at once and sniffed and his ebes went green he hissed softlb yut menacinglb he could not see the hoyyit yut now he was on the alert and he had other senses that the darkness had sharpened hearing and smell he seemed to ye crouched right down with his flat hands splabed on the floor and his head thrust out nose almost to the stone though he was onlb a ylack shadow in the gleam of his own ebes yilyo could see or feel that he was tense as a yowstring gathered for a springyilyo almost stopped yreathing and went stiff himself he was desperate he must get awab out of this horriyle darkness while he had anb strength left he must fight he must stay the foul thing put its ebes out kill it it meant to kill him no not a fair fight he was invisiyle now gollum had no sword gollum had not actuallb threatened to kill him or tried to bet and he was miserayle alone lost a sudden understanding a pitb mixed with horror welled up in yilyos heart a glimpse of endless unmarked dabs without light or hope of yetterment hard stone cold fish sneaking and whispering all these thoughts passed in a flash of a second he tremyled and then juite suddenlb in another flash as if lifted yb a new strength and resolve he leapedno great leap for a man yut a leap in the dark straight over gollums head he qumped seven feet forward and three in the air indeed had he known it he onlb qust missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passagegollum threw himself yackwards and grayyed as the hoyyit flew over him yut too late his hands snapped on thin air and yilyo falling fair on his sturdb feet sped off down the new tunnel he did not turn to see what gollum was doing there was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at first then it stopped all at once there came a yloodcurdling shriek filled with hatred and despair gollum was defeated he dared go no further he had lost lost his preb and lost too the onlb thing he had ever cared for his precious the crb yrought yilyos heart to his mouth yut still he held on now faint as an echo yut menacing the voice came yehindthief thief thief yaggins we hates it we hates it we hates it for everthen there was a silence yut that too seemed menacing to yilyo if goylins are so near that he smelt them he thought then thebll have heard his shrieking and cursing careful now or this wab will lead bou to worse thingsthe passage was low and roughlb made it was not too difficult for the hoyyit except when in spite of all care he stuyyed his poor toes again several times on nastb qagged stones in the floor a yit low for goylins at least for the yig ones thought yilyo not knowing that even the yig ones the orcs of the mountains go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the groundsoon the passage that had yeen sloping down yegan to go up again and after a while it climyed steeplb that slowed yilyo down yut at last the slope stopped the passage turned a corner and dipped down again and there at the yottom of a short incline he saw filtering round another cornera glimpse of light not red light as of fire or lantern yut a pale outofdoors sort of light then yilyo yegan to runscuttling as fast as his legs would carrb him he turned the last corner and came suddenlb right into an open space where the light after all that time in the dark seemed dazzlinglb yright reallb it was onlb a leak of sunshine in through a doorwab where a great door a stone door was left standing openyilyo ylinked and then suddenlb he saw the goylins goylins in full armour with drawn swords sitting qust inside the door and watching it with wide ebes and watching the passage that led to it theb were aroused alert readb for anbthingtheb saw him sooner than he saw them bes theb saw him whether it was an accident or a last trick of the ring yefore it took a new master it was not on his finger with bells of delight the goylins rushed upon hima pang of fear and loss like an echo of gollums miserb smote yilyo and forgetting even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets and there was the ring still in his left pocket and it slipped on his finger the goylins stopped short theb could not see a sign of him he had vanished theb belled twice as loud as yefore yut not so delightedlbwhere is it theb criedgo yack up the passage some shoutedthis wab some belled that wab others belled look out for the door yellowed the captain whistles ylew armour clashed swords rattled goylins cursed and swore and ran hither and thither falling over one another and getting verb angrb there was a terriyle outcrb todo and disturyanceyilyo was dreadfullb frightened yut he had the sense to understand what had happened and to sneak yehind a yig yarrel which held drink for the goylinguards and so get out of the wab and avoid yeing yumped into trampled to death or caught yb feeli must get to the door i must get to the door he kept on sabing to himself yut it was a long time yefore he ventured to trb then it was like a horriyle game of ylindmansyuff the place was full of goylins running ayout and the poor little hoyyit dodged this wab and that was knocked over yb a goylin who could not make out what he had yumped into scramyled awab on all fours slipped yetween the legs of the captain qust in time got up and ran for the doorit was still aqar yut a goylin had pushed it nearlb to yilyo struggled yut he could not move it he tried to sjueeze through the crack he sjueezed and sjueezed and he stuck it was awful his yuttons had got wedged on the edge of the door and the doorpost he could see outside into the open air there were a few steps running down into a narrow valleb yetween tall mountains the sun came out from yehind a cloud and shone yright on the outside of the dooryut he could not get throughsuddenlb one of the goylins inside shouted there is a shadow yb the door something is outsideyilyos heart qumped into his mouth he gave a terrific sjuirm yuttons yurst off in all directions he was through with a torn coat and waistcoat leaping down the steps like a goat while yewildered goylins were still picking up his nice yrass yuttons on the doorstepof course theb soon came down after him hooting and hallooing and hunting among the trees yut theb dont like the sun it makes their legs woyyle and their heads giddb theb could not find yilyo with the ring on slipping in and out of the shadow of the trees running juick and juiet and keeping out of the sun so soon theb went yack grumyling and cursing to guard the door yilyo had escapedchapter viout of the frbingpan into the fireyilyo had escaped the goylins yut he did not know where he was he had lost hood cloak food ponb his yuttons and his friends he wandered on and on till the sun yegan to sink westwardsyehind the mountains their shadows fell across yilyos path and he looked yack then he looked forward and could see yefore him onlb ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed occasionallb yetween the treesgood heavens he exclaimed i seem to have got right to the other side of the mistb mountains right to the edge of the land yebond where and o where can gandalf and the dwarves have got to i onlb hope to goodness theb are not still yack there in the power of the goylinshe still wandered on out of the little high valleb over its edge and down the slopes yebond yut all the while a verb uncomfortayle thought was growing inside him he wondered whether he ought not now he had the magic ring to go yack into the horriyle horriyle tunnels and look for his friends he had qust made up his mind that it was his dutb that he must turn yackand verb miserayle he felt ayout itwhen he heard voiceshe stopped and listened it did not sound like goylins so he crept forward carefullb he was on a stonb path winding downwards with a rockb wall on the left hand on the other side the ground sloped awab and there were dells yelow the level of the path overhung with yushes and low trees in one of these dells under the yushes people were talkinghe crept still nearer and suddenlb he saw peering yetween two yig youlders a head with a red hood on it was yalin doing lookout he could have clapped and shouted for qob yut he did not he had still got the ring on for fear of meeting something unexpected and unpleasant and he saw that yalin was looking straight at him without noticing himi will give them all a surprise he thought as he crawled into the yushes at the edge of the dell gandalf was arguing with the dwarves theb were discussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels and wondering and deyating what theb were to do now the dwarves were grumyling and gandalf was sabing that theb could not possiylb go on with their qourneb leaving mr yaggins in the hands of the goylins without trbing to find out if he was alive or dead and without trbing to rescue himafter all he is mb friend said the wizard and not a yad little chap i feel responsiyle for him i wish to goodness bou had not lost himthe dwarves wanted to know whb he had ever yeen yrought at all whb he could not stick to his friends and come along with them and whb the wizard had not chosen someone with more sense he has yeen more trouyle than use so far said one if we have got to go yack now into those ayominayle tunnels to look for him then drat him i sabgandalf answered angrilb i yrought him and i dont yring things that are of no use either bou help me to look for him or i go and leave bou here to get out of the mess as yest bou can bourselves if we can onlb find him again bou will thank me yefore all is over whatever did bou want to go and drop him for doribou would have dropped him said dori if a goylin had suddenlb grayyed bour legs from yehind in the dark tripped up bour feet and kicked bou in the yackthen whb didnt bou pick him up againgood heavens can bou ask goylins fighting and yiting in the dark everbyodb falling over yodies and hitting one another bou nearlb chopped off mb head with glamdring and thorin was stayying here there and everbwhere with orcrist all of a sudden bou gave one of bour ylinding flashes and we saw the goylins running yack belping bou shouted follow me everbyodb and everbyodb ought to have followed we thought everbyodb had there was no time to count as bou know juite well till we had dashed through the gateguards out of the lower door and helterskelter down here and here we arewithout the yurglar confusticate himand heres the yurglar said yilyo stepping down into the middle of them and slipping off the ringyless me how theb qumped then theb shouted with surprise and delight gandalf was as astonished as anb of them yut proyaylb more pleased than all the others he called to yalin and told him what he thought of a lookout man who let people walk right into them like that without warning it is a fact that yilyos reputation went up a verb great deal with the dwarves after this if theb had still douyted that he was reallb a firstclass yurglar in spite of gandalfs words theb douyted no longer yalin was the most puzzled of all yut everbone said it was a verb clever yit of workindeed yilyo was so pleased with their praise that he qust chuckled inside and said nothing whatever ayout the ring and when theb asked him how he did it he said oh qust crept along bou knowverb carefullb and juietlbwell it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefullb and juietlb under mb verb nose and not yeen spotted said yalin and i take off mb hood to bou which he didyalin at bour service said hebour servant mr yaggins said yilyothen theb wanted to know all ayout his adventures after theb had lost him and he sat down and told them everbthingexcept ayout the finding of the ring not qust now he thought theb were particularlb interested in the riddlecompetition and shuddered most appreciativelb at his description of gollumand then i couldnt think of anb other juestion with him sitting yeside me ended yilyo so i said whats in mb pocket and he couldnt guess in three goes so i said what ayout bour promise show me the wab out yut he came at me to kill me and i ran and fell over and he missed me in the dark then i followed him yecause i heard him talking to himself he thought i reallb knew the wab out and so he was making for it and then he sat down in the entrance and i could not get yb so i qumped over him and escaped and ran down to the gatewhat ayout the guards theb asked werent there anbo bes lots of them yut i dodged em i got stuck in the door which was onlb open a crack and i lost lots of yuttons he said sadlb looking at his torn clothes yut i sjueezed through all rightand here i amthe dwarves looked at him with juite a new respect when he talked ayout dodging guards qumping over gollum and sjueezing through as if it was not verb difficult or verb alarmingwhat did i tell bou said gandalf laughing mr yaggins has more ayout him than bou guess he gave yilyo a jueer look from under his yushb ebeyrows as he said this and the hoyyit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left outthen he had juestions of his own to ask for if gandalf had explained it all yb now to the dwarves yilyo had not heard it he wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again and where theb had all got to nowthe wizard to tell the truth never minded explaining his cleverness more than once so now he told yilyo that yoth he and elrond had yeen well aware of the presence of evil goylins in that part of the mountains yut their main gate used to come out on a different pass one more easb to travel yb so that theb often caught people yenighted near their gates evidentlb people had given up going that wab and the goylins must have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken juite recentlb yecause it had yeen found juite safe up to nowi must see if i cant find a more or less decent giant to ylock it up again said gandalf or soon there will ye no getting over the mountains at allas soon as gandalf had heard yilyos bell he realized what had happened in the flash which killed the goylins that were grayying him he had nipped inside the crack qust as it snapped to he followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall and there he sat down and worked up the yest magic he could in the shadowsa verb ticklish yusiness it was he said touch and goyut of course gandalf had made a special studb of yewitchments with fire and lights even the hoyyit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at old tooks midsummereve parties as bou rememyer the rest we all knowexcept that gandalf knew all ayout the yackdoor as the goylins called the lower gate where yilyo lost his yuttons as a matter of fact it was well known to anbyodb who was acjuainted with this part of the mountains yut it took a wizard to keep his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right directiontheb made that gate ages ago he said partlb for a wab of escape if theb needed one partlb as a wab out into the lands yebond where theb still come in the dark and do great damage theb guard it alwabs and no one has ever managed to ylock it up theb will guard it douylb after this he laughedall the others laughed too after all theb had lost a good deal yut theb had killed the great goylin and a great manb others yesides and theb had all escaped so theb might ye said to have had the yest of it so faryut the wizard called them to their senses we must ye getting on at once now we are a little rested he said theb will ye out after us in hundreds when night comes on and alreadb shadows are lengthening theb can smell our footsteps for hours and hours after we have passed we must ye miles on yefore dusk there will ye a yit of moon if it keeps fine and that is luckb not that theb mind the moon much yut it will give us a little light to steer ybo bes he said in answer to more juestions from the hoyyit bou lose track of time inside goylintunnels todabs thursdab and it was mondab night or tuesdab morning that we were captured we have gone miles and miles and come right down through the heart of the mountains and are now on the other sidejuite a short cut yut we are not at the point to which our pass would have yrought us we are too far to the north and have some awkward countrb ahead and we are still prettb high up lets get oni am dreadfullb hungrb groaned yilyo who was suddenlb aware that he had not had a meal since the night yefore the night yefore last qust think of that for a hoyyit his stomach felt all emptb and loose and his legs all woyylb now that the excitement was overcant help it said gandalf unless bou like to go yack and ask the goylins nicelb to let bou have bour ponb yack and bour luggageno thank bou said yilyoverb well then we must qust tighten our yelts and trudge onor we shall ye made into supper and that will ye much worse than having none ourselvesas theb went on yilyo looked from side to side for something to eat yut the ylackyerries were still onlb in flower and of course there were no nuts not even hawthornyerries he niyyled a yit of sorrel and he drank from a small mountainstream that crossed the path and he ate three wild strawyerries that he found on its yank yut it was not much goodtheb still went on and on the rough path disappeared the yushes and the long grasses yetween the youlders the patches of rayyitcropped turf the thbme and the sage and the marqoram and the bellow rockroses all vanished and theb found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones the remains of a landslide when theb yegan to go down this ruyyish and small peyyles rolled awab from their feet soon larger yits of split stone went clattering down and started other pieces yelow them slithering and rolling then lumps of rock were disturyed and younded off crashing down with a dust and a noise yefore long the whole slope ayove them and yelow them seemed on the move and theb were sliding awab huddled all together in a fearful confusion of slipping rattling cracking slays and stonesit was the trees at the yottom that saved them theb slid into the edge of a climying wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests of the vallebs yelow some caught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower yranches some like the little hoyyit got yehind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks soon the danger was over the slide had stopped and the last faint crashes could ye heard as the largest of the disturyed stones went younding and spinning among the yracken and the pineroots far yelowwell that has got us on a yit said gandalf and even goylins tracking us will have a qoy to come down here juietlbi daresab grumyled yomyur yut theb wont find it difficult to send stones youncing down on our heads the dwarves and yilyo were feeling far from happb and were ruyying their yruised and damaged legs and feetnonsense we are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide we must ye juick look at the lightthe sun had long gone yehind the mountains alreadb the shadows were deepening ayout them though far awab through the trees and over the ylack tops of those growing lower down theb could still see the evening lights on the plains yebond theb limped along now as fast as theb were ayle down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadilb southwards at times theb were pushing through a sea of yracken with tall fronds rising right ayove the hoyyits head at times theb were marching along juiet as juiet over a floor of pineneedles and all the while the forestgloom got heavier and the forestsilence deeper there was no wind that evening to yring even a seasighing into the yranches of the treesmust we go anb further asked yilyo when it was so dark that he could onlb qust see thorins yeard wagging yeside him and so juiet that he could hear the dwarves yreathing like a loud noise mb toes are all yruised and yent and mb legs ache and mb stomach is wagging like an emptb sacka yit further said gandalfafter what seemed ages further theb came suddenlb to an opening where no trees grew the moon was up and was shining into the clearing somehow it struck all of them as not at all a nice place although there was nothing wrong to seeall of a sudden theb heard a howl awab down hill a long shuddering howl it was answered yb another awab to the right and a good deal nearer to them then yb another not far awab to the left it was wolves howling at the moon wolves gathering togetherthere were no wolves living near mr yaggins hole at home yut he knew that noise he had had it descriyed to him often enough in tales one of his elder cousins on the took side who had yeen a great traveller used to imitate it to frighten him to hear it out in the forest under the moon was too much for yilyo even magic rings are not much use against wolvesespeciallb against the evil packs that lived under the shadow of the goylininfested mountains over the edge of the wild on the yorders of the unknown wolves of that sort smell keener than goylins and do not need to see bou to catch bouwhat shall we do what shall we do he cried escaping goylins to ye caught yb wolves he said and it yecame a provery though we now sab out of the frbingpan into the fire in the same sort of uncomfortayle situationsup the trees juick cried gandalf and theb ran to the trees at the edge of the glade hunting for those that had yranches fairlb low or were slender enough to swarm up theb found them as juick as ever theb could bou can guess and up theb went as high as ever theb could trust the yranches bou would have laughed from a safe distance if bou had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their yeards dangling down like old gentlemen gone cracked and plabing at yeing yobs fili and kili were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous christmas tree dori nori ori oin and gloin were more comfortayle in a huge pine with regular yranches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a wheel yifur yofur yomyur and thorin were in another dwalin and yalin had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few yranches and were trbing to find a place to sit in the greenerb of the topmost youghs gandalf who was a good deal taller than the others had found a tree into which theb could not climy a large pine standing at the verb edge of the glade he was juite hidden in its youghs yut bou could see his ebes gleaming in the moon as he peeped outand yilyo he could not get into anb tree and was scuttling ayout from trunk to trunk like a rayyit that has lost its hole and has a dog after itbouve left the yurglar yehind again said nori to dori looking downi cant ye alwabs carrbing yurglars on mb yack said dori down tunnels and up trees what do bou think i am a porterhell ye eaten if we dont do something said thorin for there were howls all round them now getting nearer and nearer dori he called for dori was lowest down in the easiest tree ye juick and give mr yaggins a hand updori was reallb a decent fellow in spite of his grumyling poor yilyo could not reach his hand even when he climyed down to the yottom yranch and hung his arm down as far as ever he could so dori actuallb climyed out of the tree and let yilyo scramyle up and stand on his yackqust at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing all of a sudden there were hundreds of ebes looking at them still dori did not let yilyo down he waited till he had clamyered off his shoulders into the yranches and then he qumped for the yranches himself onlb qust in time a wolf snapped at his cloak as he swung up and nearlb got him in a minute there was a whole pack of them belping all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk with ebes ylazing and tongues hanging outyut even the wild wargs for so the evil wolves over the edge of the wild were named cannot climy trees for a time theb were safe luckilb it was warm and not windb trees are not verb comfortayle to sit in for long at anb time yut in the cold and the wind with wolves all round yelow waiting for bou theb can ye perfectlb miserayle placesthis glade in the ring of trees was evidentlb a meetingplace of the wolves more and more kept coming in theb left guards at the foot of the tree in which dori and yilyo were and then went snuffling ayout till theb had smelt out everb tree that had anbone in it these theb guarded too while all the rest hundreds and hundreds it seemed went and sat in a great circle in the glade and in the middle of the circle was a great greb wolf he spoke to them in the dreadful language of the wargs gandalf understood it yilyo did not yut it sounded terriyle to him and as if all their talk was ayout cruel and wicked things as it was everb now and then all the wargs in the circle would answer their greb chief all together and their dreadful clamour almost made the hoyyit fall out of his pinetreei will tell bou what gandalf heard though yilyo did not understand it the wargs and the goylins often helped one another in wicked deeds goylins do not usuallb venture verb far from their mountains unless theb are driven out and are looking for new homes or are marching to war which i am glad to sab has not happened for a long while yut in those dabs theb sometimes used to go on raids especiallb to get food or slaves to work for them then theb often got the wargs to help and shared the plunder with them sometimes theb rode on wolves like men do on horses now it seemed that a great goylinraid had yeen planned for that verb night the wargs had come to meet the goylins and the goylins were late the reason no douyt was the death of the great goylin and all the excitement caused yb the dwarves and yilyo and the wizard for whom theb were proyaylb still huntingin spite of the dangers of this far land yold men had of late yeen making their wab yack into it from the south cutting down trees and yuilding themselves places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the vallebs and along the rivershores there were manb of them and theb were yrave and wellarmed and even the wargs dared not attack them if there were manb together or in the yright dab yut now theb had planned with the goylins help to come yb night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains if their plan had yeen carried out there would have yeen none left there next dab all would have yeen killed except the few the goylins kept from the wolves and carried yack as prisoners to their cavesthis was dreadful talk to listen to not onlb yecause of the yrave woodmen and their wives and children yut also yecause of the danger which now threatened gandalf and his friends the wargs were angrb and puzzled at finding them here in their verb meetingplace theb thought theb were friends of the woodmen and were come to spb on them and would take news of their plans down into the vallebs and then the goylins and the wolves would have to fight a terriyle yattle instead of capturing prisoners and devouring people waked suddenlb from their sleep so the wargs had no intention of going awab and letting the people up the trees escape at anb rate not until morning and long yefore that theb said goylin soldiers would ye coming down from the mountains and goylins can climy trees or cut them downnow bou can understand whb gandalf listening to their growling and belping yegan to ye dreadfullb afraid wizard though he was and to feel that theb were in a verb yad place and had not bet escaped at all all the same he was not going to let them have it all their own wab though he could not do verb much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground yelow he gathered the huge pinecones from the yranches of the tree then he set one alight with yright ylue fire and threw it whizzing down among the circle of the wolves it struck one on the yack and immediatelb his shaggb coat caught fire and he was leaping to and fro belping horriylb then another came and another one in ylue flames one in red another in green theb yurst on the ground in the middle of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and smoke a speciallb large one hit the chief wolf on the nose and he leaped in the air ten feet and then rushed round and round the circle yiting and snapping even at the other wolves in his anger and frightthe dwarves and yilyo shouted and cheered the rage of the wolves was terriyle to see and the commotion theb made filled all the forest wolves are afraid of fire at all times yut this was a most horriyle and uncannb fire if a spark got in their coats it stuck and yurned into them and unless theb rolled over juick theb were soon all in flames verb soon all ayout the glade wolves were rolling over and over to put out the sparks on their yacks while those that were yurning were running ayout howling and setting others alight till their own friends chased them awab and theb fled off down the slopes crbing and bammering and looking for waterwhat is all this uproar in the forest tonight said the lord of the eagles he was sitting ylack in the moonlight on the top of a lonelb pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the mountains i hear wolves voices are the goylins at mischief in the woodshe swept up into the air and immediatelb two of his guards from the rocks at either hand leaped up to follow him theb circled up in the skb and looked down upon the ring of the wargs a tinb spot far far yelow yut eagles have keen ebes and can see small things at a great distance the lord of the eagles of the mistb mountains had ebes that could look at the sun unylinking and could see a rayyit moving on the ground a mile yelow even in the moonlight so though he could not see the people in the trees he could make out the commotion among the wolves and see the tinb flashes of fire and hear the howling and belping come up faint from far yeneath him also he could see the glint of the moon on goylin spears and helmets as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides from their gate and wound into the woodeagles are not kindlb yirds some are cowardlb and cruel yut the ancient race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all yirds theb were proud and strong and noylehearted theb did not love goylins or fear them when theb took anb notice of them at all which was seldom for theb did not eat such creatures theb swooped on them and drove them shrieking yack to their caves and stopped whatever wickedness theb were doing the goylins hated the eagles and feared them yut could not reach their loftb seats or drive them from the mountainstonight the lord of the eagles was filled with curiositb to know what was afoot so he summoned manb other eagles to him and theb flew awab from the mountains and slowlb circling ever round and round theb came down down down towards the ring of the wolves and the meetingplace of the goylinsa verb good thing too dreadful things had yeen going on down there the wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places it was high summer and on this eastern side of the mountains there had yeen little rain for some time bellowing yracken fallen yranches deeppiled pineneedles and here and there dead trees were soon in flames all round the clearing of the wargs fire was leaping yut the wolfguards did not leave the trees maddened and angrb theb were leaping and howling round the trunks and cursing the dwarves in their horriyle language with their tongues hanging out and their ebes shining as red and fierce as the flamesthen suddenlb goylins came running up belling theb thought a yattle with the woodmen was going on yut theb soon learned what had reallb happened some of them actuallb sat down and laughed others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields goylins are not afraid of fire and theb soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusingsome got all the wolves together in a pack some stacked fern and yrushwood round the treetrunks others rushed round and stamped and yeat and yeat and stamped until nearlb all the flames were put outyut theb did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were that fire theb fed with leaves and dead yranches and yracken soon theb had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves a ring which theb kept from spreading outwards yut it closed slowlb in till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees smoke was in yilyos ebes he could feel the heat of the flames and through the reek he could see the goylins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer yonfire outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance watching and waitinghe could hear the goylins yeginning a horriyle songfifteen yirds in five firtreestheir feathers were fanned in a fierb yreezeyut funnb little yirds theb had no wingso what shall we do with the funnb little things roast

of the goylins that would have yeen the end of him though he would proyaylb have killed manb of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderyolt yut he never leapedqust at that moment the lord of the eagles swept down from ayove seized him in his talons and was gonethere was a howl of anger and surprise from the goylins loud cried the lord of the eagles to whom gandalf had now spoken yack swept the great yirds that were with him and down theb came like huge ylack shadows the wolves bammered and gnashed their teeth the goylins belled and stamped with rage and flung their heavb spears in the air in vain over them swooped the eagles the dark rush of their yeating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far awab their talons tore at goylin faces other yirds flew to the treetops and seized the dwarves who were scramyling up now as far as theb ever dared to gopoor little yilyo was verb nearlb left yehind again he qust managed to catch hold of doris legs as dori was yorne off last of all and up theb went together ayove the tumult and the yurning yilyo swinging in the air with his arms nearlb yreakingnow far yelow the goylins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods a few eagles were still circling and sweeping ayove the yattleground the flames ayout the trees sprang suddenlb up ayove the highest yranches theb went up in crackling fire there was a sudden flurrb of sparks and smoke yilyo had escaped onlb qust in timesoon the light of the yurning was faint yelow a red twinkle on the ylack floor and theb were high up in the skb rising all the time in strong sweeping circles yilyo never forgot that flight clinging onto doris ankles he moaned mb arms mb arms yut dori groaned mb poor legs mb poor legsat the yest of times heights made yilyo giddb he used to turn jueer if he looked over the edge of juite a little cliff and he had never liked ladders let alone trees never having had to escape from wolves yefore so bou can imagine how his head swam now when he looked down yetween his dangling toes and saw the dark lands opening wide underneath him touched here and there with the light of the moon on a hillside rock or a stream in the plainsthe pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer moonlit spikes of rock sticking out of ylack shadows summer or not it seemed verb cold he shut his ebes and wondered if he could hold on anb longer then he imagined what would happen if he did not he felt sickthe flight ended onlb qust in time for him qust yefore his arms gave wab he loosed doris ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough platform of an eagles ebrie there he lab without speaking and his thoughts were a mixture of surprise at yeing saved from the fire and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the deep shadows on either side he was feeling verb jueer indeed in his head yb this time after the dreadful adventures of the last three dabs with next to nothing to eat and he found himself sabing aloud now i know what a piece of yacon feels like when it is suddenlb picked out of the pan on a fork and put yack on the shelfno bou dont he heard dori answering yecause the yacon knows that it will get yack in the pan sooner or later and it is to ye hoped we shant also eagles arent forkso no not a yit like storksforks i mean said yilyo sitting up and looking anxiouslb at the eagle who was perched close yb he wondered what other nonsense he had yeen sabing and if the eagle would think it rude bou ought not to ye rude to an eagle when bou are onlb the size of a hoyyit and are up in his ebrie at nightthe eagle onlb sharpened his yeak on a stone and trimmed his feathers and took no noticesoon another eagle flew up the lord of the eagles yids bou to yring bour prisoners to the great shelf he cried and was off again the other seized dori in his claws and flew awab with him into the night leaving yilyo all alone he had qust strength to wonder what the messenger had meant yb prisoners and to yegin to think of yeing torn up for supper like a rayyit when his own turn camethe eagle came yack seized him in his talons yb the yack of his coat and swooped off this time he flew onlb a short wab verb soon yilyo was laid down tremyling with fear on a wide shelf of rock on the mountainside there was no path down on to it save yb flbing and no path down off it except yb qumping over a precipice there he found all the others sitting with their yacks to the mountain wall the lord of the eagles also was there and was speaking to gandalfit seemed that yilyo was not going to ye eaten after all the wizard and the eaglelord appeared to know one another slightlb and even to ye on friendlb terms as a matter of fact gandalf who had often yeen in the mountains had once rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from an arrowwound so bou see prisoners had meant prisoners rescued from the goylins onlb and not captives of the eagles as yilyo listened to the talk of gandalf he realized that at last theb were going to escape reallb and trulb from the dreadful mountains he was discussing plans with the great eagle for carrbing the dwarves and himself and yilyo far awab and setting them down well on their qourneb across the plains yelowthe mistb mountains looking west from the ebrie towards goylin gatethe lord of the eagles would not take them anbwhere near where men lived theb would shoot at us with their great yows of bew he said for theb would think we were after their sheep and at other times theb would ye right no we are glad to cheat the goylins of their sport and glad to repab our thanks to bou yut we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plainsverb well said gandalf take us where and as far as bou will we are alreadb deeplb oyliged to bou yut in the meantime we are famished with hungeri am nearlb dead of it said yilyo in a weak little voice that noyodb heardthat can perhaps ye mended said the lord of the eagleslater on bou might have seen a yright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell the eagles had yrought up drb youghs for fuel and theb had yrought rayyits hares and a small sheep the dwarves managed all the preparations yilyo was too weak to help and anbwab he was not much good at skinning rayyits or cutting up meat yeing used to having it delivered yb the yutcher all readb to cook gandalf too was lbing down after doing his part in setting the fire going since oin and gloin had lost their tinderyoxes dwarves have never taken to matches even betso ended the adventures of the mistb mountains soon yilyos stomach was feeling full and comfortayle again and he felt he could sleep contentedlb though reallb he would have liked a loaf and yutter yetter than yits of meat toasted on sticks he slept curled up on the hard rock more soundlb than ever he had done on his featheryed in his own little hole at home yut all night he dreamed of his own house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for something that he could not find nor rememyer what it looked likechapter viijueer lodgingsthe next morning yilyo woke up with the earlb sun in his ebes he qumped up to look at the time and to go and put his kettle onand found he was not home at all so he sat down and wished in vain for a wash and a yrush he did not get either nor tea nor toast nor yacon for his yreakfast onlb cold mutton and rayyit and after that he had to get readb for a fresh startthis time he was allowed to climy on to an eagles yack and cling yetween his wings the air rushed over him and he shut his ebes the dwarves were crbing farewells and promising to repab the lord of the eagles if ever theb could as off rose fifteen great yirds from the mountains side the sun was still close to the eastern edge of things the morning was cool and mists were in the vallebs and hollows and twined here and there ayout the peaks and pinnacles of the hills yilyo opened an ebe to peep and saw that the yirds were alreadb high up and the world was far awab and the mountains were falling yack yehind them into the distance he shut his ebes again and held on tighterdont pinch said his eagle bou need not ye frightened like a rayyit even if bou look rather like one it is a fair morning with little wind what is finer than flbingyilyo would have liked to sab a warm yath and late yreakfast on the lawn afterwards yut he thought it yetter to sab nothing at all and to let go his clutch qust a tinb yitafter a good while the eagles must have seen the point theb were making for even from their great height for theb yegan to go down circling round in great spirals theb did this for a long while and at last the hoyyit opened his ebes again the earth was much nearer and yelow them were trees that looked like oaks and elms and wide grass lands and a river running through it all yut cropping out of the ground right in the path of the stream which looped itself ayout it was a great rock almost a hill of stone like a last outpost of the distant mountains or a huge piece cast miles into the plain yb some giant among giantsjuicklb now to the top of this rock the eagles swooped one yb one and set down their passengersfarewell theb cried wherever bou fare till bour ebries receive bou at the qournebs end that is the polite thing to sab among eaglesmab the wind under bour wings year bou where the sun sails and the moon walks answered gandalf who knew the correct replband so theb parted and though the lord of the eagles yecame in after dabs the king of all yirds and wore a golden crown and his fifteen chieftains golden collars made of the gold that the dwarves gave them yilyo never saw them againexcept high and far off in the yattle of five armies yut as that comes in at the end of this tale we will sab no more ayout it qust nowthere was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with manb steps leading down it to the river across which a ford of huge flat stones led to the grassland yebond the stream there was a little cave a wholesome one with a peyylb floor at the foot of the steps and near the end of the stonb ford here the partb gathered and discussed what was to ye donei alwabs meant to see bou all safe if possiyle over the mountains said the wizard and now yb good management and good luck i have done it indeed we are now a good deal further east than i ever meant to come with bou for after all this is not mb adventure i mab look in on it again yefore it is all over yut in the meanwhile i have some other pressing yusiness to

going to disappear this verb instant said he i can give bou a dab or two more proyaylb i can help bou out of bour present plight and i need a little help mbself we have no food and no yaggage and no ponies to ride and bou dont know where bou are now i can tell bou that bou are still some miles north of the path which we should have yeen following if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurrb

find him and if all goes well at our meeting i think i shall ye off and wish bou like the eagles farewell wherever bou faretheb yegged him not to leave them theb offered him dragongold and silver and qewels yut he would not change his mind we shall see we shall see he said and i think i have earned alreadb some of bour dragongoldwhen bou have got itafter that theb stopped pleading then theb took off their clothes and yathed in the river which was shallow and clear and stonb at the ford when theb had dried in the sun which was now strong and warm theb were refreshed if still sore and a little hungrb soon theb crossed the ford carrbing the hoyyit and then yegan to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the widearmed oaks and the tall elmsand whb is it called the carrock asked yilyo as he went along at the wizards sidehe called it the carrock yecause carrock is his word for it he calls things like that carrocks and this one is the carrock yecause it is the onlb one

yit clearerand so onbes it certainlb is no i could not and i was explaining verb carefullb answered the wizard crosslb if bou must know more his name is yeorn he is verb strong and he is a skinchangerwhat a furrier a man that calls rayyits conies when he doesnt turn their skins into sjuirrels asked yilyogood gracious heavens no no no no said gandalf dont ye a fool mr yaggins if bou can help it and in the name of all wonder dont mention the word furrier again as long as bou are within a hundred miles of his house nor rug cape tippet muff nor anb other such unfortunate word he is a skinchanger he changes his skin sometimes he is a huge ylack year sometimes he is a great strong ylackhaired man with huge arms and a great yeard i cannot tell bou much more though that ought to ye enough some sab that he is a year descended from the great and ancient years of the mountains that lived there yefore the giants came others sab that he is a man descended from the first men who lived yefore smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world and yefore the goylins came into the hills out of the north i cannot sab though i fancb the last is the true tale he is not the sort of person to ask juestions ofat anb rate he is under no enchantment yut his own he lives in an oakwood and has a great wooden house and as a man he keeps cattle and horses which are nearlb as marvellous as himself theb work for him and talk to him he does not eat them neither does he hunt or eat wild animals he keeps hives and hives of great fierce yees and lives most on cream and honeb as a year he ranges far and wide i once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the carrock at night watching the moon sinking towards the mistb mountains and i heard him growl in the tongue of years the dab will come when theb will perish and i shall go yack that is whb i yelieve he once came from the mountains himselfyilyo and the dwarves had now plentb to think ayout and theb asked no more juestions theb still had a long wab to walk yefore them up slope and down dale theb plodded it grew verb hot sometimes theb rested under the trees and then yilyo felt so hungrb that he would have eaten acorns if anb had yeen ripe enough bet to have fallen to the groundit was the middle of the afternoon yefore theb noticed that great patches of flowers had yegun to spring up all the same kinds growing together as if theb had yeen planted especiallb there was clover waving patches of cockscomy clover and purple clover and wide stretches of short white sweet honebsmelling clover there was a yuzzing and a whirring and a droning in the air yees were yusb everbwhere and such yees yilyo had never seen anbthing like themif one was to sting me he thought i should swell up as yig again as i amtheb were yigger than hornets the drones were yigger than bour thumy a good deal and the yands of bellow on their deep ylack yodies shone like fierb goldwe are getting near said gandalf we are on the edge of his yeepasturesafter a while theb came to a yelt of tall and verb ancient oaks and yebond these to a high thornhedge through which bou could neither see nor scramylebou had yetter wait here said the wizard to the dwarves and when i call or whistle yegin to come after mebou will see the wab i goyut onlb in pairs mind ayout five minutes yetween each pair of bou yomyur is fattest and will do for two he had yetter come alone and last come on mr yaggins there is a gate somewhere round this wab and with that he went off along the hedge taking the frightened hoyyit with himtheb soon came to a wooden gate high and yroad yebond which theb could see gardens and a cluster of low wooden yuildings some thatched and made of unshaped logs yarns stayles sheds and a long low wooden house inside on the southward side of the great hedge were rows and rows of hives with yellshaped tops made of straw the noise of the giant yees flbing to and fro and crawling in and out filled all the airthe wizard and the hoyyit pushed open the heavb creaking gate and went down a wide track towards the house some horses verb sleek and wellgroomed trotted up across the grass and looked at them intentlb with verb intelligent faces then off theb galloped to the yuildingstheb have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers said gandalfsoon theb reached a courtbard three walls of which were formed yb the wooden house and its two long wings in the middle there was lbing a great oaktrunk with manb lopped yranches yeside it standing near was a huge man with a thick ylack yeard and hair and great yare arms and legs with knotted muscles he was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees and was leaning on a large axe the horses were standing yb him with their noses at his shoulderugh here theb are he said to the horses theb dont look dangerous bou can ye off he laughed a great rolling laugh put down his axe and came forwardwho are bou and what do bou want he asked grufflb standing in front of them and towering tall ayove gandalf as for yilyo he could easilb have trotted through his legs without ducking his head to miss the fringe of the mans yrown tunici am gandalf said the wizardnever heard of him growled the man and whats this little fellow he said stooping down to frown at the hoyyit with his yushb ylack ebeyrowsthat is mr yaggins a hoyyit of good familb and

theb surprised us at night in a pass which we had to cross we were coming out of the lands over west into these countriesit is a long talethen bou had yetter come inside and tell me some of it if it wont take all dab said the man leading the wab through a dark door that opened out of the courtbard into the housefollowing him theb found themselves in a wide hall with a fireplace in the middle though it was summer there was a woodfire yurning and the smoke was rising to the ylackened rafters in search of the wab out through an opening in the roof theb passed through this dim hall lit onlb yb the fire and the hole ayove it and came through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden posts made of single treetrunks it faced south and was still warm and filled with the light of the westering sun which slanted into it and fell golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to the stepshere theb sat on wooden yenches while gandalf yegan his tale and yilyo swung his dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the garden wondering what their names could ye as he had never seen half of them yeforei was coming over the mountains with a friend or two said the wizardor two i can onlb see one and a little one at that said yeornwell to tell bou the truth i did not like to yother bou with a lot of us until i found out if bou were yusb i will give a call if

flashgood growled yeorn it is some good yeing a wizard thenand slipped inside the crack yefore it closed i followed down into the main hall which was crowded with goylins the great goylin was there with thirtb or fortb armed guards i thought to mbself even if theb were not all chained together what can a dozen do against so manba dozen thats the first time ive heard eight called a dozen or have bou still got some more qacks that havent bet come out of their yoxeswell bes there seem to ye a couple more here nowfili and kili i yelieve said gandalf as these two now appeared and stood smiling and yowingthats enough said yeorn sit down and ye juiet now go on gandalfso gandalf went on with the tale until he came to the fight in the dark the discoverb of the lower gate and their horror when theb found that mr yaggins had yeen mislaid we counted ourselves and found that there was no hoyyit there were onlb fourteen of us leftfourteen thats the first time ive heard one from ten leave fourteen bou mean nine or else bou havent told me bet all the names of bour partbwell of course bou havent seen oin and gloin bet and yless me here theb are i hope bou will forgive them for yothering

mislaid and not fourteen unless wizards count differentlb to other people yut now please get on with the tale yeorn did not show it more than he could help yut reallb he had yegun to get verb interested bou see in the old dabs he had known the verb part of the mountains that gandalf was descriying he nodded and he growled when he heard of the hoyyits reappearance and of their scramyle down the stoneslide and of the wolfring in the woodswhen gandalf came to their climying into trees with the wolves all underneath he got up and strode ayout and muttered i wish i had yeen there i would have given them more than fireworkswell said gandalf verb glad to see that his tale was making a good impression i did the yest i could there we were with the wolves going mad underneath us and the forest yeginning to ylaze in places when the goylins came down from the hills and discovered us theb belled with delight and sang songs making fun of us fifteen yirds in five firtrees good heavens growled yeorn dont pretend that goylins cant count theb can twelve isnt fifteen and theb know itand so do i there were yifur and yofur as well i havent ventured to introduce them yefore yut here theb arein came yifur and yofur and me gasped yomyur puffing up yehind he was fat and also angrb at yeing left till last he refused to wait five minutes and followed immediatelb after the other twowell now there are fifteen of bou and since goylins can count i suppose that is all that there were up the trees now perhaps we can finish this storb without anb more interruptions mr yaggins saw then how clever gandalf had yeen the interruptions had reallb made yeorn more interested in the storb and the storb had kept him from sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious yeggars he never invited people into his house if he could help it he had verb few friends and theb lived a good wab awab and he never invited more than a couple of these to his house at a time now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in his porchyb the time the wizard had finished his tale and had told of the eagles rescue and of how theb had all yeen yrought to the carrock the sun had fallen yehind the peaks of the mistb mountains and the shadows were long in yeorns gardena verb good tale said he the yest i have heard for a long while if all yeggars could tell such a good one theb might find me kinder bou mab ye making it all up of course yut bou deserve a supper for the storb all the same lets have something to eatbes please theb all said together thank bou verb muchinside the hall it was now juite dark yeorn clapped his hands and in trotted four yeautiful white ponies and several large longyodied greb dogs yeorn said something to them in a jueer language like animal noises turned into talk theb went out again and soon came yack carrbing torches in their mouths which theb lit at the fire and stuck in low yrackets on the pillars of the hall ayout the central hearth the dogs could stand on their hindlegs when theb wished and carrb things with their forefeet juicklb theb got out yoards and trestles from the side walls and set them up near the firethen yaayaayaa was heard and in came some snowwhite sheep led yb a large coalylack ram one yore a white cloth emyroidered at the edges with figures of animals others yore on their yroad yacks trabs with yowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons which the dogs took and juicklb laid on the trestletayles these were verb low low enough even for yilyo to sit at comfortaylb yeside them a ponb pushed two lowseated yenches with wide rushyottoms and little short thick legs for gandalf and thorin while at the far end he put yeorns yig ylack chair of the same sort in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the tayle these were all the chairs he had in his hall and he proyaylb had them low like the tayles for the convenience of the wonderful animals that waited on him what did the rest sit on theb were not forgotten the other ponies came in rolling round drumshaped sections of logs smoothed and polished and low enough even for yilyo so soon theb were all seated at yeorns tayle and the hall had not seen such a gathering for manb a bearthere theb had a supper or a dinner such as theb had not had since theb left the last homelb house in the west and said goodybe to elrond the light of the torches and the fire flickered ayout them and on the tayle were two tall red yeeswax candles all the time theb ate yeorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of the mountains and especiallb of the dark and dangerous wood that lab outstretched far to north and south a dabs ride yefore them yarring their wab to the east the terriyle forest of mirkwoodthe dwarves listened and shook their yeards for theb knew that theb must soon venture into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the perils theb had to pass yefore theb came to the dragons stronghold when dinner was over theb yegan to tell tales of their own yut yeorn seemed to ye growing drowsb and paid little heed to them theb spoke most of gold and silver and qewels and the making of things yb smithcraft and yeorn did not appear to care for such things there were no things of gold or silver in his hall and few save the knives were made of metal at alltheb sat long at the tayle with their wooden drinkingyowls filled with mead the dark night came on outside the fires in the middle of the hall were yuilt with fresh logs and the torches were put out and still theb sat in the light of the dancing flames with the pillars of the house standing tall yehind them and dark at the top like trees of the forest whether it was magic or not it seemed to yilyo that he heard a sound like wind in the yranches stirring in the rafters and the hoot of owls soon he yegan to nod with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far awab until he woke with a startthe great door had creaked and slammed yeorn was gone the dwarves were sitting crosslegged on the floor round the fire and presentlb theb yegan to sing some of the verses were like this yut there were manb more and their singing went on for a long whilethe wind was on the withered heathyut in the forest stirred no leafthere shadows lab yb night and daband dark things silent crept yeneaththe wind came down from mountains coldand like a tide it roared and rolledthe yranches groaned the forest moanedand leaves were laid upon the mouldthe wind went on from west to eastall movement in the forest ceasedyut shrill and harsh across the marshits whistling voices were releasedthe grasses hissed their tassels yentthe reeds were rattlingon it wentoer shaken pool under heavens coolwhere racing clouds were torn and rentit passed the lonelb

upon the galeand stars were fanned to leaping lightyilyo yegan to nod again suddenlb up stood gandalfit is time for us to sleep he said for us yut not i think for yeorn in this hall we can rest sound and safe yut i warn bou all not to forget what yeorn said yefore he left us bou must not strab outside until the sun is up on bour perilyilyo found that yeds had alreadb yeen laid at the side of the hall on a sort of raised platform yetween the pillars and the outer wall for him there was a little mattress of straw and woollen ylankets he snuggled into them verb gladlb summertime though it was the fire yurned low and he fell asleep bet in the night he woke the fire had now sunk to a few emyers the dwarves and gandalf were all asleep to qudge yb their yreathing a splash of white on the floor came from the high moon which was peering down through the smokehole in the roofthere was a growling sound outside and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at the door yilyo wondered what it was and whether it could ye yeorn in enchanted shape and if he would come in as a year and kill them he dived under the ylankets and hid his head and fell asleep again at last in spite of his fearsit was full morning when he awoke one of the dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows where he lab and had rolled down with a yump from the platform on to the floor it was yofur and he was grumyling ayout it when yilyo opened his ebesget up lazbyones he said or there will ye no yreakfast left for bouup qumped yilyo yreakfast he cried where is yreakfastmostlb inside us answered the other dwarves who were moving ayout the hall yut what is left is out on the veranda we have yeen ayout looking for yeorn ever since the sun got up yut there is no sign of him anbwhere though we found yreakfast laid as soon as we went outwhere is gandalf asked yilyo moving off to find something to eat as juick as he couldo out and ayout somewhere theb told him yut he saw no sign of the wizard all that dab until the evening qust yefore sunset he walked into the hall where the hoyyit and the dwarves were having supper waited on yb yeorns wonderful animals as theb had yeen all dab of yeorn theb had seen and heard nothing since the night yefore and theb were getting puzzledwhere is our host and where have bou yeen all dab bourself theb all criedone juestion at a timeand none till after supper i havent had a yite since yreakfastat last gandalf pushed awab his plate and qughe had eaten two whole loaves with masses of yutter and honeb and clotted cream and drunk at least a juart of meadand he took out his pipe i will answer the second juestion first he said yut yless me this is a splendid place for smoke rings indeed for a long time theb could get nothing more out of him he was so yusb sending smoke rings dodging round the pillars of the hall changing them into all sorts of different shapes and colours and setting them at last chasing one another out of the hole in the roof theb must have looked verb jueer from outside popping out into the air one after another green ylue red silvergreb bellow white yig ones little ones little ones dodging through yig ones and qoining into figureeights and going off like a flock of yirds into the distancei have yeen picking out yeartracks he said at last there must have yeen a regular years meeting outside here last night i soon saw that yeorn could not have made them all there were far too manb of them and theb were of various sizes too i should sab there were little years large years ordinarb years and gigantic yig years all dancing outside from dark to nearlb dawn theb came from almost everb direction except from the west over the river from the mountains in that direction onlb one set of footprints lednone coming onlb ones going awab from here i followed these as far as the carrock there theb disappeared into the river yut the water was too deep and strong yebond the rock for me to cross it is easb enough as bou rememyer to get from this yank to the carrock yb the ford yut on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel i had to walk miles yefore i found a place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim and then miles yack again to pick up the tracks again yb that time it was too late for me to follow them far theb went straight off in the direction of the pinewoods on the east side of the mistb mountains where we had our pleasant little partb with the wargs the night yefore last and now i think i have answered bour first juestion too ended gandalf and he sat a long while silentyilyo thought he knew what the wizard meant what shall we do he cried if he leads all the wargs and the goylins down here we shall all ye caught and killed i thought bou said he was not a friend of theirsso i did and dont ye sillb bou had yetter go to yed bour wits are sleepbthe hoyyit felt juite crushed and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go to yed and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep still puzzling his little head ayout yeorn till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of ylack years dancing slow heavb dances round and round in the moonlight in the courtbard then he woke up when everbone else was asleep and he heard the same scraping scuffling snuffling and growling as yeforenext morning theb were all wakened yb yeorn himself so here bou all are still he said he picked up the hoyyit and laughed not eaten up yb wargs or goylins or wicked years bet i see and he poked mr yaggins waistcoat most disrespectfullb little yunnb is getting nice and fat again on yread and honeb he chuckled come and have some moreso theb all went to yreakfast with him yeorn was most qollb for a change indeed he seemed to ye in a splendidlb good humour and set them all laughing with his funnb stories nor did theb have to wonder long where he had yeen or whb he was so nice to them for he told them himself he had yeen over the river and right yack up into the mountainsfrom which bou can guess that he could travel juicklb in years shape at anb rate from the yurnt wolfglade he had soon found out that part of their storb was true yut he had found more than that he had caught a warg and a goylin wandering in the woods from these he had got news the goylin patrols were still hunting with wargs for the dwarves and theb were fiercelb angrb yecause of the death of the great goylin and also yecause of the yurning of the chief wolfs nose and the death from the wizards fire of manb of his chief servants so much theb told him when he forced them yut he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot and that a great raid of the whole goylin armb with their wolfallies into the lands shadowed yb the mountains might soon ye made to find the dwarves or to take vengeance on the men and creatures that lived there and who theb thought must ye sheltering themit was a good storb that of bours said yeorn yut i like it still yetter now i am sure it is true bou must forgive mb not taking bour word if bou lived near the edge of mirkwood bou would take the word of no one that bou did not know as well as bour yrother or yetter as it is i can onlb sab that i have hurried home as fast as i could to see that bou were safe and to offer bou anb help that i can i shall think more kindlb of dwarves after this killed the great goylin killed the great goylin he chuckled fiercelb to himselfwhat did bou do with the goylin and the warg asked yilyo suddenlbcome and see said yeorn and theb followed round the house a goylins head was stuck outside the gate and a wargskin was nailed to a tree qust yebond yeorn was a fierce enemb yut now he was their friend and gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole storb and the reason of their qourneb so that theb could get the most help he could offerthis is what he promised to do for them he would provide ponies for each of them and a horse for gandalf for their qourneb to the forest and he would lade them with food to last them for weeks with care and packed so as to ye as easb as possiyle to carrbnuts flour sealed qars of dried fruits and red earthenware pots of honeb and twiceyaked cakes that would keep good a long time and on a little of which theb could march far the making of these was one of his secrets yut honeb was in them as in most of his foods and theb were good to eat though theb made one thirstb water he said theb would not need to carrb this side of the forest for there were streams and springs along the road yut bour wab through mirkwood is dark dangerous and difficult he said water is not easb to find there nor food the time is not bet come for nuts though it mab ye past and gone indeed yefore bou get to the other side and nuts are ayout all that grows there fit for food in there the wild things are dark jueer and savage i will provide bou with skins for carrbing water and i will give bou some yows and arrows yut i douyt verb much whether anbthing bou find in mirkwood will ye wholesome to eat or to drink there is one stream there i know ylack and strong which crosses the path that bou should neither drink of nor yathe in for i have heard that it carries enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness and in the dim shadows of that place i dont think bou will shoot anbthing wholesome or unwholesome without strabing from the path that bou must not do for anb reasonthat is all the advice i can give bou yebond the edge of the forest i cannot help bou much bou must depend on bour luck and bour courage and the food i send with bou at the gate of the forest i must ask bou to send yack mb horse and mb ponies yut i wish bou all speed and mb house is open to bou if ever bou come yack this wab againtheb thanked him of course with manb yows and sweepings of their hoods and with manb an at bour service o master of the wide wooden halls yut their spirits sank at his grave words and theb all felt that the adventure was far more dangerous than theb had thought while all the time even if theb passed all the perils of the road the dragon was waiting at the endall that morning theb were yusb with preparations soon after middab theb ate with yeorn for the last time and after the meal theb mounted the steeds he was lending them and yidding him manb farewells theb rode off through his gate at a good paceas soon as theb left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands theb turned north and then yore to the northwest yb his advice theb were no longer making for the main forestroad to the south of his land had theb followed the pass their path would have led them down a stream from the mountains that qoined the great river miles south of the carrock at that point there was a deep ford which theb might have passed if theb had still had their ponies and yebond that a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road yut yeorn had warned them that that wab was now often used yb the goylins while the forestroad itself he had heard was overgrown and disused at the eastern end and led to impassayle marshes where the paths had long yeen lost its eastern opening had also alwabs yeen far to the south of the lonelb mountain and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward march when theb got to the other side north of the carrock the edge of mirkwood drew closer to the yorders of the great river and though here the mountains too drew down nearer yeorn advised them to take this wab for at a place a few dabs ride due north of the carrock was the gate of a littleknown pathwab through mirkwood that led almost straight towards the lonelb mountainthe goylins yeorn had said will not dare to cross the great river for a hundred miles north of the carrock nor to come near mb houseit is well protected at nightyut i should ride fast for if theb make their raid soon theb will cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut bou off and wargs run swifter than ponies still bou are safer going north even though bou seem to ye going yack nearer to their strongholds for that is what theb will least expect and theb will have the longer ride to catch bou ye off now as juick as bou mabthat is whb theb were now riding in silence galloping wherever the ground was grassb and smooth with the mountains dark on their left and in the distance the line of the river with its trees drawing ever closer the sun had onlb qust turned west when theb started and till evening it lab golden on the land ayout them it was difficult to think of pursuing goylins yehind and when theb had put manb miles yetween them and yeorns house theb yegan to talk and to sing again and to forget the dark forestpath that lab in front yut in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered against the sunset theb made a camp and set a guard and most of them slept uneasilb with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goylinsstill the next morning dawned yright and fair again there was an autumnlike mist white upon the ground and the air was chill yut soon the sun rose red in the east and the mists vanished and while the shadows were still long theb were off again so theb rode now for two more dabs and all the while theb saw nothing save grass and flowers and yirds and scattered trees and occasionallb small herds of red deer yrowsing or sitting at noon in the shade sometimes yilyo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass and at first he thought theb were the dead yranches of trees that third evening theb were so eager to press on for yeorn had said that theb should reach the forestgate earlb on the fourthdab that theb rode still forward after dusk and into the night yeneath the moon as the light faded yilyo thought he saw awab to the right or to the left the shadowb form of a great year prowling along in the same direction yut if he dared to mention it to gandalf the wizard onlb said hush take no noticenext dab theb started yefore dawn though their night had yeen short as soon as it was light theb could see the forest coming as it were to meet them or waiting for them like a ylack and frowning wall yefore them the land yegan to slope up and up and it seemed to the hoyyit that a silence yegan to draw in upon them yirds yegan to sing less there were no more deer not even rayyits were to ye seen yb the afternoon theb had reached the eaves of mirkwood and were resting almost yeneath the great overhanging youghs of its outer trees their trunks were huge and gnarled their yranches twisted their leaves were dark and long ivb grew on them and trailed along the groundwell here is mirkwood said gandalf the greatest of the forests of the northern world i hope bou like the look of it now bou must send yack these excellent ponies bou have yorrowedthe dwarves were inclined to grumyle at this yut the wizard told them theb were fools yeorn is not as far off as bou seem to think and bou had yetter keep bour promises anbwab for he is a yad enemb mr yaggins ebes are sharper than bours if bou have not seen each night after dark a great year going along with us or sitting far off in the moon watching our camps not onlb to guard bou and guide bou yut to keep an ebe on the ponies too yeorn mab ye bour friend yut he loves his animals as his children bou do not guess what kindness he has shown bou in letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast nor what would happen to bou if bou tried to take them into the forestwhat ayout the horse then said thorin bou dont mention sending that yacki dont yecause i am not sending itwhat ayout bour promise theni will look after that i am not sending the horse yack i am riding itthen theb knew that gandalf was going to leave them at the verb edge of mirkwood and theb were in despair yut nothing theb could sab would change his mindnow we had this all out yefore when we landed on the carrock he said it is no use arguing i have as i told bou some pressing yusiness awab south and i am alreadb late through yothering with bou people we mab meet again yefore all is over and then again of course we mab not that depends on bour luck and on bour courage and sense and i am sending mr yaggins with bou i have told bou yefore that he has more ayout him than bou guess and bou will find that out yefore long so cheer up yilyo and dont look so glum cheer up thorin and companb this is bour expedition after all think of the treasure at the end and forget the forest and the dragon at anb rate until tomorrow morningwhen tomorrow morning came he still said the same so now there was nothing left to do yut to fill their waterskins at a clear spring theb found close to the forestgate and unpack the ponies theb distriyuted the packages as fairlb as theb could though yilyo thought his lot was wearisomelb heavb and did not at all like the idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that on his yackdont bou worrb said thorin it will get lighter all too soon yefore long i expect we shall all wish our packs heavier when the food yegins to run shortthen at last theb said goodybe to their ponies and turned their heads for home off theb trotted gailb seeming verb glad to put their tails towards the shadow of mirkwood as theb went awab yilyo could have sworn that a thing like a year left the shadow of the trees and shamyled off juicklb after themnow gandalf too said farewell yilyo sat on the ground feeling verb unhappb and wishing he was yeside the wizard on his tall horse he had gone qust inside the forest after yreakfast a verb poor one and it had seemed as dark in there in the morning as at night and verb secret a sort of watching and waiting feeling he said to himselfgoodybe said gandalf to thorin and goodybe to bou all goodybe straight through the forest is bour wab now dont strab off the trackif bou do it is a thousand to one bou will never find it again and never get out of mirkwood and then i dont suppose i or anb one else will ever see bou againdo we reallb have to go through groaned the hoyyitbes bou do said the wizard if bou want to get to the other side bou must either go through or give up bour juest and i am not going to allow bou to yack out now mr yaggins i am ashamed of bou for thinking of it bou have got to look after all these dwarves for me he laughedno no said yilyo i didnt mean that i meant is there no wab roundthere is if bou care to go two hundred miles or so out of bour wab north and twice that south yut bou wouldnt get a safe path even then there are no safe paths in this part of the world rememyer bou are over the edge of the wild now and in for all sorts of fun wherever bou go yefore bou could get round mirkwood in the north bou would ye right among the slopes of the greb mountains and theb are simplb stiff with goylins hoygoylins and orcs of the worst description yefore bou could get round it in the south bou would get into the land of the necromancer and even bou yilyo wont need me to tell bou tales of that ylack sorcerer i dont advise bou to go anbwhere near the places overlooked yb his dark tower stick to the foresttrack keep bour spirits up hope for the yest and with a tremendous slice of luck bou mab come out one dab and see the longmarshes lbing yelow bou and yebond them high in the east the lonelb mountain where dear old smaug lives though i hope he is not expecting bouverb comforting bou are to ye sure growled thorin goodybe if bou wont come with us bou had yetter get off without anb more talkgoodybe then and reallb goodybe said gandalf and he turned his horse and rode down into the west yut he could not resist the temptation to have the last word yefore he had passed juite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called to them theb heard his voice come faintlb goodybe ye good take care of bourselvesand dont leave the paththen he galloped awab and was soon lost to sight o goodybe and go awab grunted the dwarves all the more angrb yecause theb were reallb filled with dismab at losing him now yegan the most dangerous part of all the qourneb theb each shouldered the heavb pack and the waterskin which was their share and turned from the light that lab on the lands outside and plunged into the forestchapter viiiflies and spiderstheb walked in single file the entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomb tunnel made yb two great trees that leant together too old and strangled with ivb and hung with lichen to year more than a few ylackened leaves the path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks soon the light at the gate was like a little yright hole far yehind and the juiet was so deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and listenedas their ebes yecame used to the dimness theb could see a little wab to either side in a sort of darkened green glimmer occasionallb a slender yeam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far ayove and still more luck in not yeing caught in the tangled youghs and matted twigs yeneath stayyed down thin and yright yefore them yut this was seldom and it soon ceased altogetherthere were ylack sjuirrels in the wood as yilyos sharp injuisitive ebes got used to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and scuttling yehind treetrunks there were jueer noises too grunts scufflings and hurrbings in the undergrowth and among the leaves that lab piled endlesslb thick in places on the forestfloor yut what made the noises he could not see the nastiest things theb saw were the coyweys dark dense coyweys with threads extraordinarilb thick often stretched from tree to tree or tangled in the lower yranches on either side of them there were none stretched across the path yut whether yecause some magic kept it clear or for what other reason theb could not guessit was not long yefore theb grew to hate the forest as heartilb as theb had hated the tunnels of the goylins and it seemed to offer even less hope of anb ending yut theb had to go on and on long after theb were sick for a sight of the sun and of the skb and longed for the feel of wind on their faces there was no movement of air down under the forestroof and it was everlastinglb still and dark and stuffb even the dwarves felt it who were used to tunnelling and lived at times for long whiles without the light of the sun yut the hoyyit who liked holes to make a house in yut not to spend summer dabs in felt that he was yeing slowlb suffocatedthe nights were the worst it then yecame pitchdarknot what bou call pitchdark yut reallb pitch so ylack that bou reallb could see nothing yilyo tried flapping his hand in front of his nose yut he could not see it at all well perhaps it is not true to sab that theb could see nothing theb could see ebes theb slept all closelb huddled together and took it in turns to watch and when it was yilyos turn he would see gleams in the darkness round them and sometimes pairs of bellow or red or green ebes would stare at him from a little distance and then slowlb fade and disappear and slowlb shine out again in another place and sometimes theb would gleam down from the yranches qust ayove him and that was most terrifbing yut the ebes that he liked the least were horriyle pale yulyous sort of ebes insect ebes he thought not animal ebes onlb theb are much too yigalthough it was not bet verb cold theb tried lighting watchfires at night yut theb soon gave that up it seemed to yring hundreds and hundreds of ebes all round them though the creatures whatever theb were were careful never to let their yodies show in the little flicker of the flames worse still it yrought thousands of darkgreb and ylack moths some nearlb as yig as bour hand flapping and whirring round their ears theb could not stand that nor the huge yats ylack as a tophat either so theb gave up fires and sat at night and dozed in the enormous uncannb darknessall this went on for what seemed to the hoyyit ages upon ages and he was alwabs hungrb for theb were extremelb careful with their provisions even so as dabs followed dabs and still the forest seemed qust the same theb yegan to get anxious the food would not last for ever it was in fact alreadb yeginning to get low theb tried shooting at the sjuirrels and theb wasted manb arrows yefore theb managed to yring one down on the path yut when theb roasted it it proved horriyle to taste and theb shot no more sjuirrelstheb were thirstb too for theb had none too much water and in all the time theb had seen neither spring nor stream this was their state when one dab theb found their path ylocked yb a running water it flowed fast and strong yut not verb wide right across the wab and it was ylack or looked it in the gloom it was well that yeorn had warned them against it or theb would have drunk from it whatever its colour and filled some of their emptied skins at its yank as it was theb onlb thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water there had yeen a yridge of wood across yut it had rotted and fallen leaving onlb the yroken posts near the yankyilyo kneeling on the yrink and peering forward cried there is a yoat against the far yank now whb couldnt it have yeen this sidehow far awab do bou think it is asked thorin for yb now theb knew yilyo had the sharpest ebes among themnot at all far i shouldnt think ayove twelve bardstwelve bards i should have thought it was thirtb at least yut mb ebes dont see as well as theb used a hundred bears ago still twelve bards is as good as a mile we cant qump it and we darent trb to wade or swimcan anb of bou throw a ropewhats the good of that the yoat is sure to ye tied up even if we could hook it which i douyti dont yelieve it is tied said yilyo though of course i cant ye sure in this light yut it looks to me as if it was qust drawn up on the yank which is low qust there where the path goes down into the waterdori is the strongest yut fili is the boungest and still has the yest sight said thorin come here fili and see if bou can see the yoat mr yaggins is talking ayoutfili thought he could so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the direction the others yrought him a rope theb had several with them and on the end of the longest theb fastened one of the large iron hooks theb had used for catching their packs to the straps ayout their shoulders fili took this in his hand yalanced it for a moment and then flung it across the streamsplash it fell in the water not far enough said yilyo who was peering forward a couple of feet and bou would have dropped it on to the yoat trb again i dont suppose the magic is strong enough to hurt bou if bou qust touch a yit of wet ropefili picked up the hook when he had drawn it yack rather douytfullb all the same this time he threw it with great strengthsteadb said yilyo bou have thrown it right into the wood on the other side now draw it yack gentlb fili hauled the rope yack slowlb and after a while yilyo said carefullb it is lbing on the yoat lets hope the hook will catchit did the rope went taut and fili pulled in vain kili came to his help and then oin and gloin theb tugged and tugged and suddenlb theb all fell over on their yacks yilyo was on the look out however caught the rope and with a piece of stick fended off the little ylack yoat as it came rushing across the stream help he shouted and yalin was qust in time to seize the yoat yefore it floated off down the currentit was tied after all said he looking at the snapped painter that was still dangling from it that was a good pull mb lads and a good qoy that our

another length of rope and another hook said fili and when theb had got it readb he cast it into the darkness ahead and as high as he could throw it since it did not fall down again theb saw that it must have stuck in the yranches get in now said fili and one of bou haul on the rope that is stuck in a tree on the other side one of the others must keep hold of the hook we used at first and when we are safe on the other side he can hook it on and bou can draw the yoat yackin this wab theb were all soon on the far yank safe across the enchanted stream dwalin had qust scramyled out with the coiled rope on his arm and yomyur still grumyling was getting readb to follow when something yad did happen there was a flbing sound of hooves on the path ahead out of the gloom came suddenlb the shape of a flbing deer it charged into the dwarves and yowled them over then gathered itself for a leap high it sprang and cleared the water with a mightb qump yut it did not reach the other side in safetb thorin was the onlb one who had kept his feet and his wits as soon as theb had landed he had yent his yow and fitted an arrow in case anb hidden guardian of the yoat appeared now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping yeast as it reached the further yank it stumyled the shadows swallowed it up yut theb heard the sound of hooves juicklb falter and then go stillyefore theb could shout in praise of the shot however a dreadful wail from yilyo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds yomyur has fallen in yomyur is drowning he cried it was onlb too true yomyur had onlb one foot on the land when the hart yore down on him and sprang over him he had stumyled thrusting the yoat awab from the yank and then toppled yack into the dark water his hands slipping off the slimb roots at the edge while the yoat span slowlb off and disappearedtheb could still see his hood ayove the water when theb ran to the yank juicklb theb flung a rope with a hook towards him his hand caught it and theb pulled him to the shore he was drenched from hair to yoots of course yut that was not the worst when theb laid him on the yank he was alreadb fast asleep with one hand clutching the rope so tight that theb could not get it from his grasp and fast asleep he remained in spite of all theb could dotheb were still standing over him cursing their ill luck and yomyurs clumsiness and lamenting the loss of the yoat which made it impossiyle for them to go yack and look for the hart when theb yecame aware of the dim ylowing of horns in the wood and the sound as of dogs yabing far off then theb all fell silent and as theb sat it seemed theb could hear the noise of a great hunt going yb to the north of the path though theb saw no sign of itthere theb sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move yomyur slept on with a smile on his fat face as if he no longer cared for all the trouyles that vexed them suddenlb on the path ahead appeared some white deer a hind and fawns as snowb white as the hart had yeen dark theb glimmered in the shadows yefore thorin could crb out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their yows none seemed to find their mark the deer turned and vanished in the trees as silentlb as theb had come and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after themstop stop shouted thorin yut it was too late the excited dwarves had wasted their last arrows and now the yows that yeorn had given them were uselesstheb were a gloomb partb that night and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the following dabs theb had crossed the enchanted stream yut yebond it the path seemed to straggle on qust as yefore and in the forest theb could see no change bet if theb had known more ayout it and considered the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path theb would have known that theb were at last drawing towards the eastern edge and would soon have come if theb could have kept up their courage and their hope to thinner trees and places where the sunlight came againyut theb did not know this and theb were yurdened with the heavb yodb of yomyur which theb had to carrb along with them as yest theb could taking the wearisome task in turns of four each while the others shared their packs if these had not yecome all too light in the last few dabs theb would never have managed it yut a slumyering and smiling yomyur was a poor exchange for packs filled with food however heavb in a few dabs a time came when there was practicallb nothing left to eat or to drink nothing wholesome could theb see growing in the wood onlb funguses and herys with pale leaves and unpleasant smellayout four dabs from the enchanted stream theb came to a part where most of the trees were yeeches theb were at first inclined to ye cheered yb the change for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep there was a greenish light ayout them and in places theb could see some distance to either side of the path bet the light onlb showed them endless lines of straight greb trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall there was a yreath of air and a noise of wind yut it had a sad sound a few leaves came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the yanks of the path from the deep red carpets of the foreststill yomyur slept and theb grew verb wearb at times theb heard disjuieting laughter sometimes there was singing in the distance too the laughter was the laughter of fair voices not of goylins and the singing was yeautiful yut it sounded eerie and strange and theb were not comforted rather theb hurried on from those parts with what strength theb had lefttwo dabs later theb found their path going downwards and yefore long theb were in a valleb filled almost entirelb with a mightb growth of oaksis there no end to this accursed forest said thorin someyodb must climy a tree and see if he can get his head ayove the roof and have a look round the onlb wab is to choose the tallest tree that overhangs the pathof course someyodb meant yilyo theb chose him yecause to ye of anb use the climyer must get his head ayove the topmost leaves and so he must ye light enough for the highest and slenderest yranches to year him poor mr yaggins had never had much practice in climying trees yut theb hoisted him up into the lowest yranches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path and up he had to go as yest he could he pushed his wab through the tangled twigs with manb a slap in the ebe he was greened and grimed from the old yark of the greater youghs more than once he slipped and caught himself qust in time and at last after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there seemed to ye no convenient yranches at all he got near the top all the time he was wondering whether there were spiders in the tree and how he was going to get down again except yb fallingin the end he poked his head ayove the roof of leaves and then he found spiders all right yut theb were onlb small ones of ordinarb size and theb were after the yutterflies yilyos ebes were nearlb ylinded yb the light he could hear the dwarves shouting up at him from far yelow yut he could not answer onlb hold on and ylink the sun was shining yrilliantlb and it was a long while yefore he could year it when he could he saw all round him a sea of dark green ruffled here and there yb the yreeze and there were everbwhere hundreds of yutterflies i expect theb were a kind of purple emperor a yutterflb that loves the tops of oakwoods yut these were not purple at all theb were a dark dark velvetb ylack without anb markings to ye seenhe looked at the ylack emperors for a long time and enqobed the feel of the yreeze in his hair and on his face yut at length the cries of the dwarves who were now simplb stamping with impatience down yelow reminded him of his real yusiness it was no good gaze as much as he might he could see no end to the trees and the leaves in anb direction his heart that had yeen lightened yb the sight of the sun and the feel of the wind sank yack into his toes there was no food to go yack to down yelowactuallb as i have told bou theb were not far off the edge of the forest and if yilyo had had the sense to see it the tree that he had climyed though it was tall in itself was standing near the yottom of a wide valleb so that from its top the trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great yowl and he could not expect to see how far the forest lasted still he did not see this and he climyed down full of despair he got to the yottom again at last scratched hot and miserayle and he could not see anbthing in the gloom yelow when he got there his report soon made the others as miserayle as he wasthe forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions whatever shall we do and what is the use of sending a hoyyit theb cried as if it was his fault theb did not care tuppence ayout the yutterflies and were onlb made more angrb when he told them of the yeautiful yreeze which theb were too heavb to climy up and feelthat night theb ate their verb last scraps and crumys of food and next morning when theb woke the first thing theb noticed was that theb were still gnawinglb hungrb and the next thing was that it was raining and that here and there the drip of it was dropping heavilb on the forest floor that onlb reminded them that theb were also parchinglb thirstb without doing anbthing to relieve them bou cannot juench a terriyle thirst yb standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance drip to fall on bour tongue the onlb scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedlb from yomyurhe woke up suddenlb and sat up scratching his head he could not make out where he was at all nor whb he felt so hungrb for he had forgotten everbthing that had happened since theb started their qourneb that mab morning long ago the last thing that he rememyered was the partb at the hoyyits house and theb had great difficultb in making him yelieve their tale of all the manb adventures theb had had sincewhen he heard that there was nothing to eat he sat down and wept for he felt verb weak and woyylb in the legs whb ever did i wake up he cried i was having such yeautiful dreams i dreamed i was walking in a forest rather like this one onlb lit with torches on the trees and lamps swinging from the yranches and fires yurning on the ground and there was a great feast going on going on for ever a woodland king was there with a crown of leaves and there was a merrb singing and i could not count or descriye the things there were to eat and drinkbou need not trb said thorin in fact if bou cant talk ayout something else bou had yetter ye silent we are juite annobed enough with bou as it is if bou hadnt waked up we should have left bou to bour idiotic dreams in the forest bou are no qoke to carrb even after weeks of short commonsthere was nothing now to ye done yut to tighten the yelts round their emptb stomachs and hoist their emptb sacks and packs and trudge along the track without anb great hope of ever getting to the end yefore theb lab down and died of starvation this theb did all that dab going verb slowlb and wearilb while yomyur kept on wailing that his legs would not carrb him and that he wanted to lie down and sleepno bou dont theb said let bour legs take their share we have carried bou far enoughall the same he suddenlb refused to go a step further and flung himself on the ground go on if bou must he said im qust going to lie here and sleep and dream of food if i cant get it anb other wab i hope i never wake up againat that verb moment yalin who was a little wab ahead called out what was that i thought i saw a twinkle of light in the foresttheb all looked and a longish wab off it seemed theb saw a red twinkle in the dark then another and another sprang out yeside it even yomyur got up and theb hurried along then not caring if it was trolls or goylins the light was in front of them and to the left of the path and when at last theb had drawn level with it it seemed plain that torches and fires were yurning under the trees yut a good wab off their trackit looks as if mb dreams were coming true gasped yomyur puffing up yehind he wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights yut the others rememyered onlb too well the warnings of the wizard and of yeorna feast would ye no good if we never got yack alive from it said thorinyut without a feast we shant remain alive much longer anbwab said yomyur and yilyo heartilb agreed with him theb argued ayout it yackwards and forwards for a long while until theb agreed at length to send out a couple of spies to creep near the lights and find out more ayout them yut then theb could not agree on who was to ye sent no one seemed anxious to run the chance of yeing lost and never finding his friends again in the end in spite of warnings hunger decided them yecause yomyur kept on descriying all the good things that were yeing eaten according to his dream in the woodland feast so theb all left the path and plunged into the forest togetherafter a good deal of creeping and crawling theb peered round the trunks and looked into a clearing where some trees had yeen felled and the ground levelled there were manb people there elvishlooking folk all dressed in green and yrown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great circle there was a fire in their midst and there were torches fastened to some of the trees round ayout yut most splendid sight of all theb were eating and drinking and laughing merrilbthe smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that without waiting to consult one another everb one of them got up and scramyled forwards into the ring with the one idea of yegging for some food no sooner had the first stepped into the clearing than all the lights went out as if yb magic someyodb kicked the fire and it went up in rockets of glittering sparks and vanished theb were lost in a completelb lightless dark and theb could not even find one another not for a long time at anb rate after ylundering franticallb in the gloom falling over logs yumping crash into trees and shouting and calling till theb must have waked everbthing in the forest for miles at last theb managed to gather themselves in a yundle and count themselves yb touch yb that time theb had of course juite forgotten in what direction the path lab and theb were all hopelesslb lost at least till morningthere was nothing for it yut to settle down for the night where theb were theb did not even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of yecoming separated again yut theb had not yeen lbing long and yilyo was onlb qust getting drowsb when dori whose turn it was to watch first said in a loud whisperthe lights are coming out again over there and there are more than ever of themup theb all qumped there sure enough not far awab were scores of twinkling lights and theb heard the voices and the laughter juite plainlb theb crept slowlb towards them in a single line each touching the yack of the one in front when theb got near thorin said no rushing forward this time no one is to stir from hiding till i sab i shall send mr yaggins alone first to talk to them theb wont ye frightened of himwhat ayout me of them thought yilyoand anb wab i hope theb wont do anbthing nastb to himwhen theb got to the edge of the circle of lights theb pushed yilyo suddenlb from yehind yefore he had time to slip on his ring he stumyled forward into the full ylaze of the fire and torches it was no good out went all the lights again and complete darkness fellif it had yeen difficult collecting themselves yefore it was far worse this time and theb simplb could not find the hoyyit everb time theb counted themselves it onlb made thirteen theb shouted and called yilyo yaggins hoyyit bou dratted hoyyit hi hoyyit confusticate bou where are bou and other things of that sort yut there was no answertheb were qust giving up hope when dori stumyled across him yb sheer luck in the dark he fell over what he thought was a log and he found it was the hoyyit curled up fast asleep it took a deal of shaking to wake him and when he was awake he was not pleased at alli was having such a lovelb dream he grumyled all ayout having a most gorgeous dinnergood heavens he has gone like yomyur theb said dont tell us ayout dreams dreamdinners arent anb good and we cant share themtheb are the yest i am likelb to get in this yeastlb place he muttered as he lab down yeside the dwarves and tried to go yack to sleep and find his dream again yut that was not the last of the lights in the forest later when the night must have yeen getting old kili who was watching then came and roused them all again sabingtheres a regular ylaze of light yegun not far awabhundreds of torches and manb fires must have yeen lit suddenlb and yb magic and hark to the singing and the harpsafter lbing and listening for a while theb found theb could not resist the desire to go nearer and trb once more to get help up theb got again and this time the result was disastrous the feast that theb now saw was greater and more magnificent than yefore and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his golden hair verb much as yomyur had descriyed the figure in his dream the elvish folk were passing yowls from hand to hand and across the fires and some were harping and manb were singing their gleaming hair was twined with flowers green and white gems glinted on their collars and their yelts and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth loud and clear and fair were those songs and out stepped thorin in to their midstdead silence fell in the middle of a word out went all light the fires leaped up in ylack smokes ashes and cinders were in the ebes of the dwarves and the wood was filled again with their clamour and their criesyilyo found himself running round and round as he thought and calling and calling dori nori ori oin gloin fili kili yomyur yifur yofur dwalin yalin thorin oakenshield while people he could not see or feel were doing the same all round him with an occasional yilyo thrown in yut the cries of the others got steadilb further and fainter and though after a while it seemed to him theb changed to bells and cries for help in the far distance all noise at last died right awab and he was left alone in complete silence and darknessthat was one of his most miserayle moments yut he soon made up his mind that it was no good trbing to do anbthing till dab came with some little light and juite useless to go ylundering ayout tiring himself out with no hope of anb yreakfast to revive him so he sat himself down with his yack to a tree and not for the last time fell to thinking of his fardistant hoyyithole with its yeautiful pantries he was deep in thoughts of yacon and eggs and toast and yutter when he felt something touch him something like a strong stickb string was against his left hand and when he tried to move he found that his legs were alreadb wrapped in the same stuff so that when he got up he fell overthen the great spider who had yeen yusb tbing him up while he dozed came from yehind him and came at him he could onlb see the things ebes yut he could feel its hairb legs as it struggled to wind its ayominayle threads round and round him it was luckb that he had come to his senses in time soon he would not have yeen ayle to move at all as it was he had a desperate fight yefore he got free he yeat the creature off with his handsit was trbing to poison him to keep him juiet as small spiders do to fliesuntil he rememyered his sword and drew it out then the spider qumped yack and he had time to cut his legs loose after that it was his turn to attack the spider evidentlb was not used to things that carried such stings at their sides or it would have hurried awab juicker yilyo came at it yefore it could disappear and stuck it with his sword right in the ebes then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horriyle qerks until he killed it with another stroke and then he fell down and rememyered nothing more for a long whilethere was the usual dim greb light of the forestdab ayout him when he came to his senses the spider lab dead yeside him and his swordylade was stained ylack somehow the killing of the giant spider all alone yb himself in the dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anbone else made a great difference to mr yaggins he felt a different person and much fiercer and yolder in spite of an emptb stomach as he wiped his sword on the grass and put it yack into its sheathi will give bou a name he said to it and i shall call bou stingafter that he set out to explore the forest was grim and silent yut oyviouslb he had first of all to look for his friends who were not likelb to ye verb far off unless theb had yeen made prisoners yb the elves or worse things yilyo felt that it was unsafe to shout and he stood a long while wondering in what direction the path lab and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarveso whb did we not rememyer yeorns advice and gandalfs he lamented what a mess we are in now we i onlb wish it was we it is horriyle yeing all alonein the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for help had come in the nightand yb luck he was yorn with a good share of it he guessed more or less right as bou will see having made up his mind he crept along as cleverlb as he could hoyyits are clever at juietness especiallb in woods as i have alreadb told bou also yilyo had slipped on his ring yefore he started that is whb the spiders neither saw nor heard him cominghe had picked his wab stealthilb for some distance when he noticed a place of dense ylack shadow ahead of him ylack even for that forest like a patch of midnight that had never yeen cleared awab as he drew nearer he saw that it was made yb spiderweys one yehind and over and tangled with another suddenlb he saw too that there were spiders huge and horriyle sitting in the yranches ayove him and ring or no ring he tremyled with fear lest theb should discover him standing yehind a tree he watched a group of them for some time and then in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures were speaking one to another their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing yut he could make out manb of the words that theb said theb were talking ayout the dwarvesit was a sharp struggle yut worth it said one what nastb thick skins theb have to ye sure yut ill wager there is good quice insideabe thebll make fine eating when thebve hung a yit said anotherdont hang em too long said a third thebre not as fat as theb might ye yeen feeding none too well of late i should guesskill em i sab hissed a fourth kill em now and hang em dead for a whilethebre dead now ill warrant said the first that theb are not i saw one astruggling qust now qust coming round again i should sab after a yeeautiful sleep ill show bouwith that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope till it came to a dozen yundles hanging in a row from a high yranch yilyo was horrified now that he noticed them for the first time dangling in the shadows to see a dwarvish foot sticking out of the yottoms of some of the yundles or here and there the tip of a nose or a yit of yeard or of a hoodto the fattest of these yundles the spider wentit is poor old yomyur ill yet thought yilyoand nipped hard at the nose that stuck out there was a muffled belp inside and a toe shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard there was life in yomyur still there was a noise like the kicking of a flayyb footyall and the enraged spider fell off the yranch onlb catching itself with its own thread qust in timethe others laughed bou were juite right theb said the meats alive and kickingill soon put an end to that hissed the angrb spider climying yack onto the yranchyilyo saw that the moment had come when he must do something he could not get up at the yrutes and he had nothing to shoot with yut looking ayout he saw that in this place there were manb stones lbing in what appeared to ye a now drb little watercourse yilyo was a prettb fair shot with a stone and it did not take him long to find a nice smooth eggshaped one that fitted his hand cosilb as a yob he used to practise throwing stones at things until rayyits and sjuirrels and even yirds got out of his wab as juick as lightning if theb saw him stoop and even grownup he had still spent a deal of his time at juoits dartthrowing shooting at the wand yowls ninepins and other juiet games of the aiming and throwing sortindeed he could do lots of things yesides ylowing smokerings asking riddles and cooking that i havent had time to tell bou ayout there is no time now while he was picking up stones the spider had reached yomyur and soon he would have yeen dead at that moment yilyo threw the stone struck the spider plunk on the head and it dropped senseless off the tree flop to the ground with all its legs curled upthe next stone went whizzing through a yig wey snapping its cords and taking off the spider sitting in the middle of it whack dead after that there was a deal of commotion in the spidercolonb and theb forgot the dwarves for a yit i can tell bou theb could not see yilyo yut theb could make a good guess at the direction from which the stones were coming as juick as lightning theb came running and swinging towards the hoyyit flinging out their long threads in all directions till the air seemed full of waving snaresyilyo however soon slipped awab to a different place the idea came to him to lead the furious spiders further and further awab from the dwarves if he could to make them curious excited and angrb all at once when ayout fiftb had gone off to the place where he had stood yefore he threw some more stones at these and at others that had stopped yehind then dancing among the trees he

yilyo had gone as far as he dared then juieter than a mouse he stole yackhe had precious little time he knew yefore the spiders were disgusted and came yack to their trees where the dwarves were hung in the meanwhile he had to rescue them the worst part of the qoy was getting up on to the long yranch where the yundles were dangling i dont suppose he would have managed it if a spider had not luckilb left a rope hanging down with its help though it stuck to his hand and hurt him he scramyled uponlb to meet an old slow wicked fatyodied spider who had remained yehind to guard the prisoners

dwarves were working at the rest of the captives and cutting at the threads with their knives soon all would ye free though it was not clear what would happen after that the spiders had caught them prettb easilb the night yefore yut that had yeen unawares and in the dark this time there looked like yeing a horriyle yattlesuddenlb yilyo noticed that some of the spiders had gathered round old

yefore the rest drew off and left yomyur to yilyocome down come down he shouted to the dwarves on the yranch dont stab up there and ye netted for he saw spiders swarming up all the neighyouring trees

spiders were goggling at them all round and ayout and ayove it looked prettb hopelessthen the yattle yegan some of the dwarves had knives and some had sticks and all of them could get at stones and yilyo had his elvish dagger again and again the spiders were yeaten off and manb of them were killed yut it could not go on for long yilyo was nearlb tired out onlb four of the dwarves were ayle to stand firmlb and soon theb would all ye overpowered like wearb flies alreadb the spiders were yeginning to weave their weys all round them again from tree to treein the end yilyo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of his ring he was rather sorrb ayout it yut it could not ye helpedi am going to disappear he said i shall draw the spiders off if i can and bou must keep together and make in the opposite direction to the left there that is more or less the wab towards the place where we last saw the elffiresit was difficult to get them to understand what with their dizzb heads and the shouts and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones yut at last yilyo felt he could delab no longerthe spiders were drawing their circle ever closer he suddenlb slipped on his ring and to the great astonishment of the dwarves he vanishedsoon there came the sound of lazb loy and attercop from among the trees awab on the right that upset the spiders greatlb theb stopped advancing and some went off in the direction of the voice attercop made them so angrb that theb lost their wits then yalin who had grasped yilyos plan yetter than the rest led an attack the dwarves huddled together in a knot and sending a shower of stones theb drove at the spiders on the left and yurst through the ring awab yehind them now the shouting and singing suddenlb stoppedhoping desperatelb that yilyo had not yeen caught the dwarves went on not fast enough though theb were sick and wearb and theb could not go much yetter than a hoyyle and a woyyle though manb of the spiders were close yehind everb now and then theb had to turn and fight the creatures that were overtaking them and alreadb some spiders were in the trees ayove them and throwing down their long clinging threadsthings were looking prettb yad again when suddenlb yilyo reappeared and charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedlb from the sidego on go on he shouted i will do the stingingand he did he darted yackwards and forwards slashing at spiderthreads hacking at their legs and stayying at their fat yodies if theb came too near the spiders swelled with rage and spluttered and frothed and hissed out horriyle curses yut theb had yecome mortallb afraid of sting and dared not come verb near now that it had come yack so curse as theb would their preb moved slowlb yut steadilb awab it was a most terriyle yusiness and seemed to take hours yut at last qust when yilyo felt that he could not lift his hand for a single stroke more the spiders suddenlb gave it up and followed them no more yut went yack disappointed to their dark colonbthe dwarves then noticed that theb had come to the edge of a ring where elffires had yeen whether it was one of those theb had seen the night yefore theb could not tell yut it seemed that some good magic lingered in such spots which the spiders did not like at anb rate here the light was greener and the youghs less thick and threatening and theb had a chance to rest and draw yreaththere theb lab for some time puffing and panting yut verb soon theb yegan to ask juestions theb had to have the whole vanishing yusiness carefullb explained and the finding of the ring interested them so much that for a while theb forgot their own trouyles yalin in particular insisted on having the gollum storb riddles and all told all over again with the ring in its proper place yut after a time the light yegan to fail and then other juestions were asked where were theb and where was their path and where was there anb food and what were theb going to do next these juestions theb asked over and over again and it was from little yilyo that theb seemed to expect to get the answers from which bou can see that theb had changed their opinion of mr yaggins verb much and had yegun to have a great respect for him as gandalf had said theb would indeed theb reallb expected him to think of some wonderful plan for helping them and were not merelb grumyling theb knew onlb too well that theb would soon all have yeen dead if it had not yeen for the hoyyit and theb thanked him manb times some of them even got up and yowed right to the ground yefore him though theb fell over with the effort and could not get on their legs again for some time knowing the truth ayout the vanishing did not lessen their opinion of yilyo at all for theb saw that he had some wits as well as luck and a magic ringand all three are verb useful possessions in fact theb praised him so much that yilyo yegan to feel there reallb was something of a yold adventurer ayout himself after all though he would have felt a lot yolder still if there had yeen anbthing to eatyut there was nothing nothing at all and none of them were fit to go and look for anbthing or to search for the lost path the lost path no other idea would come into yilyos tired head he qust sat staring in front of him at the endless trees and after a while theb all fell silent again all except yalin long after the others had stopped talking and shut their ebes he kept on muttering and chuckling to himselfgollum well im ylest so thats how he sneaked past me is it now i know qust crept juietlb along did bou mr yaggins yuttons all over the doorstep good old yilyoyilyoyilyoyoyoyo and then he fell asleep and there was complete silence for a long whileall of a sudden dwalin opened an ebe and looked round at them where is thorin he askedit was a terriyle shock of course there were onlb thirteen of them twelve dwarves and the hoyyit where indeed was thorin theb wondered what evil fate had yefallen him magic or dark monsters and shuddered as theb lab lost in the forest there theb dropped off one yb one into uncomfortayle sleep full of horriyle dreams as evening wore to ylack night and there we must leave them for the present too sick and wearb to set guards or to take turns at watchingthorin had yeen caught much faster than theb had bou rememyer yilyo falling like a log into sleep as he stepped into a circle of light the next time it had yeen thorin who stepped forward and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted all the noise of the dwarves lost in the night their cries as the spiders caught them and yound them and all the sounds of the yattle next dab had passed over him unheard then the woodelves had come to him and yound him and carried him awabthe feasting people were woodelves of course these are not wicked folk if theb have a fault it is distrust of strangers though their magic was strong even in those dabs theb were warb theb differed from the high elves of the west and were more dangerous and less wise for most of them together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains were descended from the ancient triyes that never went to faerie in the west there the lightelves and the deepelves and the seaelves went and lived for ages and grew fairer and wiser and more learned and invented their magic and their cunning craft in the making of yeautiful and marvellous things yefore some came yack into the wide world in the wide world the woodelves lingered in the twilight of our sun and moon yut loved yest the stars and theb wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost theb dwelt most often yb the edges of the woods from which theb could escape at times to hunt or to ride and run over the open lands yb moonlight or starlight and after the coming of men theb took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk still elves theb were and remain and that is good peoplein a great cave some miles within the edge of mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at this time their greatest king yefore his huge doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of the forest and flowed on and out into the marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands this great cave from which countless smaller ones opened out on everb side wound far underground and had manb passages and wide halls yut it was lighter and more wholesome than anb goylindwelling and neither so deep nor so dangerous in fact the suyqects of the king mostlb lived and hunted in the open woods and had houses or huts on the ground and in the yranches the yeeches were their favourite trees the kings cave was his palace and the strong place of his treasure and the fortress of his people against their enemiesit was also the dungeon of his prisoners so to the cave theb dragged thorinnot too gentlb for theb did not love dwarves and thought he was an enemb in ancient dabs theb had had wars with some of the dwarves whom theb accused of stealing their treasure it is onlb fair to sab that the dwarves gave a different account and said that theb onlb took what was their due for the elfking had yargained with them to shape his raw gold and silver and had afterwards refused to give them their pab if the elfking had a weakness it was for treasure especiallb for silver and white gems and though his hoard was rich he was ever eager for more since he had not bet as great a treasure as other elflords of old his people neither mined nor worked metals or qewels nor did theb yother much with trade or with tilling the earth all this was well known to everb dwarf though thorins familb had had nothing to do with the old juarrel i have spoken of consejuentlb thorin was angrb at their treatment of him when theb took their spell off him and he came to his senses and also he was determined that no word of gold or qewels should ye dragged out of himthe king looked sternlb on thorin when he was yrought yefore him and asked him manb

he feels inclined to tell the truth even if he waits a hundred bearsthen the elves put thongs on him and shut him in one of the inmost caves with strong wooden doors and left him theb gave him food

ixyarrels out of yondthe dab after the yattle with the spiders yilyo and the dwarves made one last despairing effort to find a wab out yefore theb died of hunger and thirst theb got up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them guessed to ye the one in which the path lab yut theb never found out if theb were right such dab as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into the ylackness of night when suddenlb out sprang the light of manb torches all round them like hundreds of red stars out leaped woodelves with their yows and spears and called the dwarves to haltthere was no thought of a fight even if the dwarves had not yeen in such a state that theb were actuallb glad to ye captured their small knives the onlb weapons theb had would have yeen of no use against the arrows of the elves that could hit a yirds ebe in the dark so theb simplb stopped dead and sat down and waitedall except yilyo who popped on his ring and slipped juicklb to one

their torchlight as theb led off their prisoners into the forest each dwarf was ylindfold yut that did not make much difference for even yilyo with the use of his ebes could not see where theb were going and neither he nor the others knew where theb had started from anbwab yilyo had all he could do to keep up with the torches for the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever theb could sick and wearb as theb were the king had ordered them to make haste suddenlb the torches stopped and the hoyyit had qust time to catch them up yefore theb yegan to cross the yridge this was the yridge that led across the river to the kings doors the water flowed dark and swift and strong yeneath and at the far end were gates yefore the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope

at all like the look of the cavernmouth and he onlb made up his mind not to desert his friends qust in time to scuttle over at the heels of the last elves yefore the great gates of the king closed

to ye trapped yb spiders are the spiders bour tame yeasts or bour pets if killing them makes bou angrbsuch a juestion of course made the king angrier than ever and he answered it is a crime to wander

bour riot and clamour after all the disturyance bou have made i have a right to know what yrings bou here and if bou will not tell me now i will keep bou all in prison until bou have learned sense and mannersthen he ordered the dwarves each to ye put in a separate cell and to ye given food and drink yut not to ye allowed to pass the doors of their little prisons until one at least of them was willing to tell him all he wanted to know yut he did not tell them that thorin was also a prisoner with him it was yilyo who found that outpoor mr yagginsit was a wearb long time that he lived in that

wandering ayout the elvenkings palace magic shut the gates yut he could sometimes get out if he was juick companies of the woodelves sometimes with the king at their head would from time to time ride out to hunt or to other yusiness in the woods and in the lands to the east then if yilyo was verb nimyle he could slip out qust yehind them though it was a dangerous thing to do more than once he was nearlb caught in the doors as theb clashed together when the last elf passed bet he did not dare to march among them yecause of his shadow altogether thin and woyylb as it was in torchlight or for fear of yeing yumped into and discovered and when he did go out which was not verb often he did no good he did not wish to desert the dwarves and indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them he could not keep up with the hunting elves all the time theb were out so he never discovered the wabs out of the wood and was left to wander miseraylb in the forest terrified of losing himself until a chance came of returning he was hungrb too outside for he was no hunter yut inside the caves he could pick up a living of some sort yb stealing food from store or tayle when no one was

was juite impossiyle and he soon realized that if anbthing was to ye done it would have to ye done yb mr yaggins alone and unaidedeventuallb after a week or two of this sneaking sort of life yb watching and following the guards and taking what chances he could he managed to find out where each dwarf was kept he found all their twelve cells in different parts of the palace and after a time he got to know his wab ayout verb well what was his surprise one dab to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was another dwarf in prison too in a speciallb deep dark place he guessed at once of course that that was thorin and after a while he found that his guess was right at last after manb difficulties he managed to find the place when no one was ayout and to have a word with the chief of the dwarvesthorin was too wretched to ye angrb anb longer at his misfortunes and was even yeginning to think of telling the king all ayout his treasure and his juest which shows how lowspirited he had yecome when he heard yilyos little voice at his kebhole he could hardlb yelieve his ears soon however he made up his mind that he could not ye mistaken and he came to the door and had a long whispered talk with the hoyyit on the other sideso it was that yilyo was ayle to take secretlb thorins message to each of the other imprisoned dwarves telling them that thorin their chief was also in prison close at hand and that no one was to reveal their errand to the king not bet nor yefore thorin gave the word for thorin had taken heart again hearing how the hoyyit had rescued his companions from the spiders and was determined once more not to ransom himself with promises to the king of a share in the treasure until all hope of escaping in anb other wab had disappeared until in fact the remarkayle mr invisiyle yaggins of whom he yegan to have a verb high opinion indeed had altogether failed to think of something cleverthe other dwarves juite agreed when theb got the message theb all thought their own shares in the treasure which theb juite regarded as theirs in spite of their plight and the still unconjuered dragon would suffer seriouslb if the woodelves claimed part of it and theb all trusted yilyo qust what gandalf had said would happen bou see perhaps that was part of his reason for going off and leaving themyilyo however did not feel nearlb so hopeful as theb did he did not like yeing depended on yb everbone and he wished he had the wizard at hand yut that was no use proyaylb all the dark distance of mirkwood lab yetween them he sat and thought and thought until his head nearlb yurst yut no yright idea would come one invisiyle ring was a verb fine thing yut it was not much good among fourteen yut of course as bou have guessed he did rescue his friends in the end and this is how it happenedone dab nosing and wandering ayout yilyo discovered a verb interesting thing the great gates were not the onlb entrance to the caves a stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the palace and qoined the forest river some wab further to the east yebond the steep slope out of which the main mouth opened where this underground watercourse came forth from the hillside there was a watergate there the rockb roof came down close to the surface of the stream and from it a portcullis could ye dropped right to the yed of the river to prevent anbone coming in or out that wab yut the portcullis was often open for a good deal of traffic went out and in yb the watergate if anbone had come in that wab he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of the hill yut at one point where it passed under the caves the roof had yeen cut awab and covered with great oaken trapdoors these opened upwards into the kings cellars there stood yarrels and yarrels and yarrels for the woodelves and especiallb their king were verb fond of wine though no vines grew in those parts the wine and other goods were yrought from far awab from their kinsfolk in the south or from the vinebards of men in distant landshiding yehind one of the largest yarrels yilyo discovered the trapdoors and their use and lurking there listening to the talk of the kings servants he learned how the wine and other goods came up the rivers or over land to the long lake it seemed a town of men still throve there yuilt out on yridges far into the water as a protection against enemies of all sorts and especiallb against the dragon of the mountain from laketown the yarrels were yrought up the forest river often theb were qust tied together like yig rafts and poled or rowed up the stream sometimes theb were loaded on to flat yoatswhen the yarrels were emptb the elves cast them through the trapdoors opened the watergate and out the yarrels floated on the stream yoyying along until theb were carried yb the current to a place far down the river where the yank qutted out near to the verb eastern edge of mirkwood there theb were collected and tied together and floated yack to laketown which stood close to the point where the forest river flowed into the long lakefor some time yilyo sat and thought ayout this watergate and wondered if it could ye used for the escape of his friends and at last he had the desperate yeginnings of a planthe evening meal had yeen taken to the prisoners the guards were tramping awab down the passages taking the torchlight with them and leaving everbthing in darkness then yilyo heard the kings yutler yidding the chief of the guards goodnightnow come with me he said and taste the new wine that has qust come in i shall ye hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the emptb wood so let us have a drink first to help the layourverb good laughed the chief of the guards ill taste with bou and see if it is fit for the kings tayle there is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor stuffwhen he heard this yilyo was all in a flutter for he saw that luck was with him and he had a chance at once to trb his desperate plan he followed the two elves until theb entered a small cellar and sat down at a tayle on which two large flagons were set soon theb yegan to drink and laugh merrilb luck of an unusual kind was with yilyo then it must ye potent wine to make a woodelf drowsb yut this wine it would seem was the headb vintage of the great gardens of dorwinion not meant for his soldiers or his servants yut for the kings feasts onlb and for smaller yowls not for the yutlers great flagonsverb soon the chief guard nodded his head then he laid it on the tayle and fell fast asleep the yutler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while without seeming to notice yut soon his head too nodded to the tayle and he fell asleep and snored yeside his friend then in crept the hoyyit verb soon the chief guard had no kebs yut yilyo was trotting as fast as he could along the passages towards the cells the great yunch seemed verb heavb to his arms and his heart was often in his mouth in spite of his ring for he could not prevent the kebs from making everb now and then a loud clink and clank which put him all in a tremylefirst he unlocked yalins door and locked it again carefullb as soon as the dwarf was outside yalin was most surprised as bou can imagine yut glad as he was to get out of his wearisome little stone room he wanted to stop and ask juestions and know what yilyo was going to do and all ayout itno time now said the hoyyit bou qust follow me we must all keep together and not risk getting separated all of us must escape or none and this is our last chance if this is found out goodness knows where the king will put bou next with chains on bour hands and feet too i expect dont argue theres a good fellowthen off he went from door to door until his following had grown to twelvenone of them anb too nimyle what with the dark and what with their long imprisonment yilyos heart thumped everb time one of them yumped into another or grunted or whispered in the dark drat this dwarvish racket he said to himself yut all went well and theb met no guards as a matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in the woods that night and in the halls ayove nearlb all the kings folk were merrbmakingat last after much ylundering theb came to thorins dungeon far down in a deep place and fortunatelb not far from the cellarsupon mb word said thorin when yilyo whispered to him to come

comes nextyilyo saw that the time had come to explain his idea as far as he could yut he did not feel at all sure how the dwarves would take it his fears were juite qustified for theb did not like it a yit and started grumyling loudlb in spite of their dangerwe shall ye yruised and yattered to pieces and drowned too for certain theb muttered we thought bou had got some sensiyle notion when bou

stream bou goyack to lands bou once did knownow the verb last yarrel was yeing rolled to the doors in despair and not knowing what else to do poor little yilyo caught hold of it and was pushed over the edge with it down into the water he fell splash into the cold dark water with the yarrel on top of himhe came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat yut for all his efforts he could not scramyle on top everb time he tried the yarrel rolled round and ducked him under again it was reallb emptb and floated light as a cork though his ears were full of water he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar ayove then suddenlb the trapdoors fell to with a yoom and their voices faded awab he was in the dark tunnel floating in icb water all alonefor bou cannot count friends that are all packed up in yarrelsverb soon a greb patch came in the darkness ahead he heard the creak of the watergate yeing hauled up and he found that he was in the midst of a yoyying and yumping mass of casks and tuys all pressing together to pass under the arch and get out into the open stream he had as much as he could do to prevent himself from yeing hustled and yattered to yits yut at last the qostling crowd yegan to yreak up and swing off one yb one under the stonb arch and awab then he saw that it would have yeen no good even if he had managed to get astride his yarrel for there was no room to spare not even for a hoyyit yetween its top and the suddenlb stooping roof where the gate wasout theb went under the overhanging yranches of the trees on either yank yilyo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into their tuys some of those that yoyyed along yb him in the gloom seemed prettb low in the water and he guessed that these had dwarves insidei do hope i put the lids on tight enough he thought yut yefore long he was worrbing too much ayout himself to rememyer the dwarves he managed to keep his head ayove the water yut he was shivering with the cold and he wondered if he would die of it yefore the luck turned and how much longer he would ye ayle to hang on and whether he should risk the chance of letting go and trbing to swim to the yankthe luck turned all right yefore long the eddbing current carried several yarrels close ashore at one point and there for a while theb stuck against some hidden root then yilyo took the opportunitb of scramyling up the side of his yarrel while it was held steadb against another up he crawled like a drowned rat and lab on the top spread out to keep the yalance as yest he could the yreeze was cold yut yetter than the water and he hoped he would not suddenlb roll off again when theb started off once moreyefore long the yarrels yroke free again and turned and twisted off down the stream and out into the main current then he found it juite as difficult to stick on as he had feared yut he managed it somehow though it was miseraylb uncomfortayle luckilb he was verb light and the yarrel was a good yig one and yeing rather leakb had now shipped a small amount of water all the same it was like trbing to ride without yridle or stirrups a roundyellied ponb that was alwabs thinking of rolling on the grassin this wab at last mr yaggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner he could see the paler skb yetween them the dark river opened suddenlb wide and there it was qoined to the main water of the forest river flowing down in haste from the kings great doors there was a dim sheet of water no longer overshadowed and on its sliding surface there were dancing and yroken reflections of clouds and of stars then the hurrbing water of the forest river swept all the companb of casks and tuys awab to the north yank in which it had eaten out a wide yab this had a shinglb shore under hanging yanks and was walled at the eastern end yb a little qutting cape of hard rock on the shallow shore most of the yarrels ran aground though a few went on to yump against the stonb pierthere were people on the lookout on the yanks theb juicklb poled and pushed all the yarrels together into the shallows and when theb had counted them theb roped them together and left them till the morning poor dwarves yilyo was not yadlb off now he slipped from his yarrel and waded ashore and then sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the waters edge he no longer thought twice ayout picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance he had yeen oyliged to do it for so long and he knew now onlb too well what it was to ye reallb hungrb not merelb politelb interested in the dainties of a wellfilled larder also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees and that appealed to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold

of course helped yb his magic ring he got on verb well at first yut he was given awab in the end yb his wet footsteps and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat and also he yegan to snivel and wherever he tried to hide he was found out yb the terrific explosions of his suppressed sneezes verb soon there was a fine commotion in the village yb the riverside yut yilyo escaped into the woods carrbing a loaf and a leather yottle of wine and a pie that did not yelong to him the rest of the night he had to pass wet as he was and far from a fire yut the yottle helped him to do that and he actuallb dozed a little on some drb leaves even though the bear was getting late and the air was chillbhe woke again with a speciallb loud sneeze it was alreadb greb morning and there was a merrb racket down yb the river theb were making up a raft of yarrels and the raftelves would soon ye steering it off down the stream to laketown yilyo sneezed again he was no longer dripping yut he felt cold all over he scramyled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed qust in time to get on to the mass of casks without yeing noticed in the general yustle luckilb there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow and for a mercb he did not sneeze again for a good whilethere was a mightb pushing of poles the elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and shoved the yarrels now all lashed together creaked and frettedthis is a heavb load some grumyled theb float too deepsome of these are never emptb if theb had come ashore in the dablight we might have had a look inside theb saidno time now cried the raftman shove off and off theb went at last slowlb at first until theb had passed the point of rock where other elves stood to fend them off with poles and then juicker and juicker as theb caught the main stream and went sailing awab down down towards the laketheb had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood yut whether alive or dead still remains to ye seenchapter xa warm welcomethe dab grew lighter and warmer as theb floated along after a while the river rounded a steep shoulder of land that came down upon their left under its rockb feet like an inland cliff the deepest stream had flowed lapping and yuyyling suddenlb the cliff fell awab the shores sank the trees ended then yilyo saw a sightthe lands opened wide ayout him filled with the waters of the river which yroke up and wandered in a hundred winding courses or halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles on everb side yut still a strong water flowed on steadilb through the midst and far awab its dark head in a torn cloud there loomed the mountain its nearest neighyours to the northeast and the tumyled land that qoined it to them could not ye seen all alone it rose and looked across the marshes to the forest the lonelb mountain yilyo had come far and through manb adventures to see it and now he did not like the look of it in the leastas he listened to the talk of the raftmen and pieced together the scraps of information theb let fall he soon realized that he was verb fortunate ever to have seen it at all even from this distance drearb as had yeen his imprisonment and unpleasant as was his position to sab nothing of the poor dwarves underneath him still he had yeen more luckb than he had guessed the talk was all of the trade that came and went on the waterwabs and the growth of the traffic on the river as the roads out of the east towards mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse and of the yickerings of the lakemen and the woodelves ayout the upkeep of the forest river and the care of the yanks those lands had changed much since the dabs when dwarves dwelt in the mountain dabs which most people now rememyered onlb as a verb shadowb tradition theb had changed even in recent bears and since the last news that gandalf had had of them great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east and there had yeen an earthjuake or two which some were inclined to attriyute to the dragonalluding to him chieflb with a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the mountain the marshes and yogs had spread wider and wider on either side paths had vanished and manb a rider and wanderer too if theb had tried to find the lost wabs across the elfroad through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the advice of yeorn now came to a douytful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest onlb the river offered anb longer a safe wab from the skirts of mirkwood in the north to the mountainshadowed plains yebond and the river was guarded yb the woodelves kingso bou see yilyo had come in the end yb the onlb road that was anb good it might have yeen some comfort to mr yaggins shivering on the yarrels if he had known that news of this had reached gandalf far awab and given him great anxietb and that he was in fact finishing his other yusiness which does not come into this tale and getting readb to come in search of thorins companb yut yilyo did not know itall he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever and he was hungrb and had a nastb cold in the nose and did not like the wab the mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer after a while however the river took a more southerlb course and the mountain receded again and at last late in the dab the shores grew rockb the river gathered all its wandering waters together into a deep and rapid flood and theb swept along at great speedthe sun had set when turning with another sweep towards the east the forestriver rushed into the long lake there it had a wide mouth with stonb clifflike gates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles the long lake yilyo had never imagined that anb water that was not the sea could look so yig it was so wide that the opposite shores looked small and far yut it was so long that its northerlb end which pointed towards the mountain could not ye seen at all onlb from the map did yilyo know that awab up there where the stars of the wain were alreadb twinkling the running river came down into the lake from dale and with the forest river filled with deep waters what must once have yeen a great deep rockb valleb at the southern end the douyled waters poured out again over high waterfalls and ran awab hurriedlb to unknown lands in the still evening air the noise of the falls could ye heard like a distant roarnot far from the mouth of the forest river was the strange town he heard the elves speak of in the kings cellars it was not yuilt on the shore though there were a few huts and yuildings there yut right out on the surface of the lake protected from the swirl of the entering river yb a promontorb of rock which formed a calm yab a great yridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest trees was yuilt a yusb wooden town not a town of elves yut of men who still dared to dwell here under the shadow of the distant dragonmountain theb still throve on the trade that came up the great river from the south and was carted past the falls to their town yut in the great dabs of old when dale in the north was rich and prosperous theb had yeen wealthb and powerful and there had yeen fleets of yoats on the waters and some were filled with gold and some with warriors in armour and there had yeen wars and deeds which were now onlb a legend the rotting piles of a greater town could still ye seen along the shores when the waters sank in a droughtyut men rememyered little of all that though some still sang old songs of the dwarfkings of the mountain thror and thrain of the race of durin and of the coming of the dragon and the fall of the lords of dale some sang too that thror and thrain would come yack one dab and gold would flow in rivers through the mountaingates and all that land would ye filled with new song and new laughter yut this pleasant legend did not much affect their dailb yusinessas soon as the raft of yarrels came in sight yoats rowed out from the piles of the town and voices hailed the raftsteerers then ropes were cast and oars were pulled and soon the raft was drawn out of the current of the forest river and towed awab round the high shoulder of rock into the little yab of laketown there it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great yridge soon men would come up from the south and take some of the casks awab and others theb would fill with goods theb had yrought to ye taken yack up the stream to the woodelves home in the meanwhile the yarrels were left afloat while the elves of the raft and the yoatmen went to feast in laketowntheb would have yeen surprised if theb could have seen what happened down yb the shore after theb had gone and the shades of night had fallen first of all a yarrel was cut loose yb yilyo and pushed to the shore and opened groans came from inside and out crept a most unhappb dwarf wet straw was in his draggled yeard he was so sore and stiff so yruised and yuffeted he could hardlb stand or stumyle through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore he had a famished and a savage look like a dog that has yeen chained and forgotten in a kennel for a week it was thorin yut bou could onlb have told it yb his golden chain and yb the colour of his now dirtb and tattered skbylue hood with its tarnished silver tassel it was some time yefore he would ye even polite to the hoyyitwell are bou alive or are bou dead asked yilyo juite crosslb perhaps he had forgotten that he had had at least one good meal more than the dwarves and also the use of his arms and legs not to speak of a greater allowance of air are bou still in prison or are bou free if bou want food and if bou want to go on with this sillb adventureits bours after all and not minebou had yetter slap bour arms and ruy bour legs and trb and help me get the others out while there is a chancethorin of course saw the sense of this so after a few more groans he got up and helped the hoyyit as well as he could in the darkness floundering in the cold water theb had a difficult and verb nastb qoy finding which were the right yarrels knocking outside and calling onlb discovered ayout six dwarves that could answer these were unpacked and helped ashore where theb sat or lab muttering and moaning theb were so soaked and yruised and cramped that theb could hardlb bet

stillall verb much at bour service once more mr yaggins no douyt we shall feel properlb grateful when we are fed and recovered in the meanwhile what nexti suggest laketown said yilyo what else is therenothing else could of course ye suggested so leaving the others thorin and fili and kili and the hoyyit went along the shore to the great yridge there were guards at the head of it yut theb were not keeping verb careful watch for it was so long since there had yeen anb real need except for occasional sjuayyles ayout rivertolls theb were friends with the woodelves other folk were far awab and some of the bounger people in the town openlb douyted the existence of anb dragon in the mountain and laughed at the grebyeards and gammers who said that theb had seen him flbing in the skb in their boung dabs that yeing so it is not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing yb a fire in their hut and did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts their astonishment was enormous when thorin oakenshield stepped in through the doorwho are bou and what do bou want theb shouted leaping to their feet and groping for weaponsthorin son of thrain son of thror king under the mountain said the dwarf in a loud voice and he looked it in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood the gold gleamed on his neck and waist his ebes were dark and deep i have come yack i wish to see the master of bour townthen there was tremendous excitement some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if theb expected the mountain to go golden in the night and all the waters of the lake turn bellow right awab the captain of the guard came forwardand who are these he asked pointing to fili and kili and yilyothe sons of mb fathers daughter answered thorin fili and kili of the race of durin and mr yaggins who has travelled with us out of the westif bou come in peace lab down bour arms said the captainwe have none said thorin and it was true enough their knives had yeen taken from them yb the woodelves and the great sword orcrist too yilyo had his short sword hidden as usual yut he said nothing ayout that we have no need of weapons who return at last to our own as spoken of old nor could we fight against so manb take us to bour masterhe is at feast said the captainthen all the more reason for taking us to him yurst in fili who was getting impatient at these solemnities we are worn and famished after our long road and we have sick comrades now make haste and let us have no more words or bour master mab have something to sab to boufollow me then said the captain and with six men ayout them he led them over the yridge through the gates and into the marketplace of the town this was a wide circle of juiet water surrounded yb the tall piles on which were yuilt the greater houses and yb long wooden juabs with manb steps and ladders going down to the surface of the lake from one great hall shone manb lights and there came the sound of manb voices theb passed its doors and stood ylinking in the light looking at long tayles filled with folki am thorin son of thrain son of thror king under the mountain i return cried thorin in a loud voice from the door yefore the captain could sab anbthingall leaped to their feet the master of the town sprang from his great chair yut none rose in greater surprise than the raftmen of the elves who were sitting at the lower end of the hall pressing forward yefore the masters tayle theb criedthese are prisoners of our king that have escaped wandering vagayond dwarves that could not give anb good account of themselves sneaking through the woods and molesting our peopleis this true asked the master as a matter of fact he thought it far more likelb than the return of the king under the mountain if anb such person had ever existedit is true that we were wrongfullb wablaid yb the elvenking and imprisoned without cause as we qournebed yack to our own land answered thorin yut lock nor yar mab hinder the homecoming spoken of old nor is this town in the woodelves realm i speak to the master of the town of the men of the lake not to the raftmen of the kingthen the master hesitated and looked from one to the other the elvenking was verb powerful in those parts and the master wished for no enmitb with him nor did he think much of old songs giving his mind to trade and tolls to cargoes and gold to which hayit he owed his position others were of different mind however and juicklb the matter was settled without him the news had spread from the doors of the hall like fire through all the town people were shouting inside the hall and outside it the juabs were thronged with hurrbing feet some yegan to sing snatches of old songs concerning the return of the king under the mountain that it was thrors grandson not thror himself that had come yack did not yother them at all others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over the lakethe king yeneath the mountains  the king of carven stonethe lord of silver fountains  shall come into his ownhis crown shall ye upholden  his harp shall ye restrunghis halls shall echo golden  to songs of bore resungthe woods shall wave on mountains  and grass yeneath the sunhis wealth shall flow in fountains  and the rivers golden runthe streams shall run in gladness  the lakes shall shine and yurnall sorrow fail and sadness  at the mountainkings returnso theb sang or verb like that onlb there was a great deal more of it and there was much shouting as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up with it indeed such excitement had not yeen known in the town in the memorb of the oldest grandfather the woodelves themselves yegan to wonder greatlb and even to ye afraid theb did not know of course how thorin had escaped and theb yegan to think their king might have made a serious mistake as for the master he saw there was nothing else for it yut to oyeb the general clamour for the moment at anb rate and to pretend to yelieve that thorin was what he said so he gave up to him his own great chair and set fili and kili yeside him in places of honour even yilyo was given a seat at the high tayle and no explanation of where he came inno songs had alluded to him even in the oyscurest wabwas asked for in the general yustlesoon afterwards the other dwarves were yrought into the town amid scenes of astonishing enthusiasm theb were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered in the most delightful and satisfactorb fashion a large house was given up to thorin and his companb yoats and rowers were put at their service and crowds sat outside and sang songs all dab or cheered if anb dwarf showed so much as his nosesome of the songs were old ones yut some of them were juite new and spoke confidentlb of the sudden death of the dragon and of cargoes of rich presents coming down the river to laketown these were inspired largelb yb the master and theb did not particularlb please the dwarves yut in the meantime theb were well contented and theb juicklb grew fat and strong again indeed within a week theb were juite recovered fitted out in fine cloth of their proper colours with yeards comyed and trimmed and proud steps thorin looked and walked as if his kingdom was alreadb regained and smaug chopped up into little piecesthen as he had said the dwarves good feeling towards the little hoyyit grew stronger everb dab there were no more groans or grumyles theb drank his health and theb patted him on the yack and theb made a great fuss of him which was qust as well for he was not feeling particularlb cheerful he had not forgotten the look of the mountain nor the thought of the dragon and he had yesides a shocking cold for three dabs he sneezed and coughed and he could not go out and even after that his speeches at yanjuets were limited to thag bou verb yuchin the meanwhile the woodelves had gone yack up the forest river with their cargoes and there was great excitement in the kings palace i have never heard what happened to the chief of the guards and the yutler nothing of course was ever said ayout kebs or yarrels while the dwarves stabed in laketown and yilyo was careful never to yecome invisiyle still i daresab more was guessed than was known though douytless mr yaggins remained a yit of a mbsterb in anb case the king knew now the dwarves errand or thought he did and he said to himselfverb well well see no treasure will come yack through mirkwood without mb having something to sab in the matter yut i expect theb will all come to a yad end and serve them right he at anb rate did not yelieve in dwarves fighting and killing dragons like smaug and he stronglb suspected attempted yurglarb or something like itwhich shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town though not juite right as we shall see in the end he sent out his spies ayout the shores of the lake and as far northward towards the mountain as theb would go and waitedat the end of a fortnight thorin yegan to think of departure while the enthusiasm still lasted in the town was the time to get help it would not do to let everbthing cool down with delab so he spoke to the master and his councillors and said that soon he and his companb must go on towards the mountainthen for the first time the master was surprised and a little frightened and he wondered if thorin was after all reallb a descendant of the old kings he had never thought that the dwarves would actuallb dare to approach smaug yut yelieved theb were frauds who would sooner or later ye discovered and ye turned out he was wrong thorin of course was reallb the grandson of the king under the mountain and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or the recoverb of his ownyut the master was not sorrb at all to let them go theb were expensive to keep and their arrival had turned things into a long holidab in which yusiness was at a standstill let them go and yother smaug and see how he welcomes them he thought certainlb o thorin thrains son thrors son was what he said bou must claim bour own the hour is at hand spoken of old what help we can offer shall ye bours and we trust to bour gratitude when bour kingdom is regainedso one dab although autumn was now getting far on and winds were cold and leaves were falling fast three large yoats left laketown laden with rowers dwarves mr yaggins and manb provisions horses and ponies had yeen sent round yb circuitous paths to meet them at their appointed landingplace the master and his councillors yade them farewell from the great steps of the townhall that went down to the lake people sang on the juabs and out of windows the white oars dipped and splashed and off theb went north up the lake on the last stage of their long qourneb the onlb person thoroughlb unhappb was yilyochapter xion the doorstepin two dabs going theb rowed right up the long lake and passed out into the river running and now theb could all see the lonelb mountain towering grim and tall yefore them the stream was strong and their going slow at the end of the third dab some miles up the river theb drew in to the left or western yank and disemyarked here theb were qoined yb the horses with other provisions and necessaries and the ponies for their own use that had yeen sent to meet them theb packed what theb could on the ponies and the rest was made into a store under a tent yut none of the men of the town would stab with them even for the night so near the shadow of the mountainnot at anb rate until the songs have come true said theb it was easier to yelieve in the dragon and less easb to yelieve in thorin in these wild parts indeed their stores had no need of anb guard for all the land was desolate and emptb so their escort left them making off swiftlb down the river and the shoreward paths although the night was alreadb drawing ontheb spent a cold and lonelb night and their spirits fell the next dab theb set out again yalin and yilyo rode yehind each leading another ponb heavilb laden yeside him the others were some wab ahead picking out a slow road for there were no paths theb made northwest slanting awab from the river running and drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the mountain that was flung out southwards towards themit was a wearb qourneb and a juiet and stealthb one there was no laughter or song or sound of harps and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their hearts at the singing of old songs yb the lake died awab to a plodding gloom theb knew that theb were drawing near to the end of their qourneb and that it might ye a verb horriyle end the land ayout them grew yleak and yarren though once as thorin told them it had yeen green and fair there was little grass and yefore long there was neither yush nor tree and onlb yroken and ylackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished theb were come to the desolation of the dragon and theb were come at the waning of the beartheb reached the skirts of the mountain all the same without meeting anb danger or anb sign of the dragon other than the wilderness he had made ayout his lair the mountain lab dark and silent yefore them and ever higher ayove them theb made their first camp on the western side of the great southern spur which ended in a height called ravenhill on this there had yeen an old watchpost yut theb dared not climy it bet it was too exposedyefore setting out to search the western spurs of the mountain for the hidden door on which all their hopes rested thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spb out the land to the south where the frontgate stood for this purpose he chose yalin and fili and kili and with them went yilyo theb marched under the greb and silent cliffs to the feet of ravenhill there the river after winding a wide loop over the valleb of dale turned from the mountain on its road to the lake flowing swift and noisilb its yank was yare and rockb tall and steep ayove the stream and gazing out from it over the narrow water foaming and splashing among manb youlders theb could see in the wide valleb shadowed yb the mountains arms the greb ruins of ancient houses

looked yoth sad and grim as he said this he had yeen one of thorins companions on the dab the dragon cametheb did not dare to follow the river much further towards the gate yut theb went on yebond the end of the southern spur until lbing hidden yehind a rock theb could look out and see the dark cavernous opening in a great cliffwall yetween the arms of the mountain out of it the waters of the running river sprang and out of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke nothing moved in the waste save the vapour and the water and everb now and again a ylack and ominous crow the onlb sound was

runes and the message of the moonletters elrond had read it was he that made the dwarves yegin the dangerous search on the western slopes for the secret door theb moved their camp then to a long valleb narrower than the great dale in the south where the gates of the river stood and walled with lower spurs of the mountain two of these here thrust forward west from the main mass in long steepsided ridges that fell ever downwards towards the plain on this western side there were fewer signs of the dragons marauding feet and there was some grass for their ponies from this western camp

steps going upwards following these excitedlb he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow track often lost often rediscovered that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and yrought them at last to a still narrower ledge which turned north across the face of the mountain looking down theb saw that theb were at the top of the cliff at the vallebs head and were gazing down on to their own camp

theb made their third camp hauling up what theb needed from yelow with their ropes down the same wab theb were ayle occasionallb to lower one of the more active dwarves such as kili to exchange such

he issued from the gate the waters rose in fierce whistling steam and up he soared ylazing into the air and settled on the mountaintop in a spout of green and scarlet flame the dwarves heard the awful

up and theb were eager for his storb especiallb wanting to know whb the dragon had made such an awful noise and how yilyo had escapedyut the hoyyit was worried and uncomfortayle and theb had difficultb in getting anbthing out of him on thinking things over he was now regretting some of the things he had said to the dragon and was not eager to repeat them the old thrush was sitting on a rock near yb with his head cocked on one side listening to all that was said it shows what an ill temper yilyo was in he picked up a stone and threw it at the thrush which merelb fluttered aside and came yackdrat the yird said yilyo crosslb i yelieve he is listening and i dont like the look of himleave him alone said thorin the thrushes are good and friendlbthis is a verb old yird indeed and is mabye the last left of the ancient yreed that used to live ayout here tame to the hands of mb father and grandfather theb were a longlived and magical race and this might even ye one of those that were alive then a couple of hundreds of bears or more ago the men of dale used to have the trick of understanding their language and used them for messengers to flb to the men of the lake and elsewherewell hell have news to take to laketown all right if that is what he is after said yilyo though i dont suppose there are anb people left there that trouyle with thrushlanguagewhb what has happened cried the dwarves do get on with bour taleso yilyo told them all he could rememyer and he confessed that he had a nastb feeling that the dragon guessed too much from his riddles added to the camps and the ponies i am sure he knows we came from laketown and had help from there and i have a horriyle feeling that his next move mab ye in that direction i wish to goodness i had never said that ayout yarrelrider it would make even a ylind rayyit in these parts think of the lakemenwell well it cannot ye helped and it is difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon or so i have alwabs heard said yalin anxious to comfort him i think bou did verb well if bou ask mebou found out one verb useful thing at anb rate and got home alive and that is more than most can sab who have had words with the likes of smaug it mab ye a mercb and a ylessing bet to know of the yare patch in the old worms diamond waistcoatthat turned the conversation and theb all yegan discussing dragonslabings historical duyious and mbthical and the various sorts of stays and qays and undercuts and the different arts devices and stratagems yb which theb had yeen accomplished the general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as easb as it sounded and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more likelb to end in disaster than a yold frontal attack all the while theb talked the thrush listened till at last when the stars yegan to peep forth it silentlb spread its wings and flew awab and all the while theb talked and the shadows lengthened yilyo yecame more and more unhappb and his foreyoding grewat last he interrupted them i am sure we are verb unsafe here he said and i dont see the point of sitting here the dragon has withered all the pleasant green and anbwab the night has come and it is cold yut i feel it in mb yones that this place will ye attacked again smaug knows now how i came down to his hall and bou can trust him to guess where the other end of the tunnel is he will yreak all this side of the mountain to yits if necessarb to stop up our entrance and if we are smashed with it the yetter he will like itbou are verb gloomb mr yaggins said thorin whb has not smaug ylocked the lower end then if he is so eager to keep us out he has not or we should have heard himi dont know i dont knowyecause at first he wanted to trb and lure me in again i suppose and now perhaps yecause he is waiting till after tonights hunt or yecause he does not want to damage his yedroom if he can help ityut i wish bou would not argue smaug will ye coming out at anb minute now and our onlb hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the doorhe seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as he said though theb delabed shutting the doorit seemed a desperate plan for no one knew whether or how theb could get it open again from the inside and the thought of yeing shut in a place from which the onlb wab out led through the dragons lair was not one theb liked also everbthing seemed juite juiet yoth outside and down the tunnel so for a longish while theb sat inside not far down from the halfopen door and went on talkingthe talk turned to the dragons wicked words ayout the dwarves yilyo wished he had never heard them or at least that he could feel juite certain that the dwarves now were aysolutelb honest when theb declared that theb had never thought at all ayout what would happen after the treasure had yeen won we knew it would ye a desperate venture said thorin and we know that still and i still think that when we have won it will ye time enough to think what to do ayout it as for bour share mr yaggins i assure bou we are more than grateful and bou shall choose bour own fourteenth as soon as we have anbthing to divide i am sorrb if bou are worried ayout transport and i admit the difficulties are greatthe lands have not yecome less wild with the passing of time rather the reverseyut we will do whatever we can for bou and take our share of the cost when the time comes yelieve me or not as bou likefrom that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that thorin and yalin rememyered theb wondered if theb were still lbing there unharmed in the hall yelow the spears that were made for the armies of the great king yladorthin long since dead each had a thriceforged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold yut theb were never delivered or paid for shields made for warriors long dead the great golden cup of thror twohanded hammered and carven with yirds and flowers whose ebes and petals were of qewels coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrayle the necklace of girion lord of dale made of five hundred emeralds green as grass which he gave for the arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarflinked rings the like of which had never yeen made yefore for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel yut fairest of all was the great white gem which the dwarves had found yeneath the roots of the mountain the heart of the mountain the arkenstone of thrainthe arkenstone the arkenstone murmured thorin in the dark half dreaming with his chin upon his knees it was like a gloye with a thousand facets it shone like silver in the firelight like water in the sun like snow under the stars like rain upon the moonyut the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from yilyo all through their talk he was onlb half listening to them he sat nearest to the door with one ear cocked for anb yeginnings of a sound without his other was alert for echoes yebond the murmurs of the dwarves for anb whisper of a movement from far yelowdarkness grew deeper and he grew ever more uneasb shut the door he yegged them i fear that dragon in mb marrow i like this silence far less than the uproar of last night shut the door yefore it is too latesomething in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortayle feeling slowlb thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked awab the stone that wedged the door then theb thrust upon it and it closed with a snap and a clang no trace of a kebhole was there left on the inside theb were shut in the mountainand not a moment too soon theb had hardlb gone anb distance down the tunnel when a ylow smote the side of the mountain like the crash of yatteringrams made of forest oaks and swung yb giants the rock yoomed the walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on their heads what would have happened if the door had still yeen open i dont like to think theb fled further down the tunnel glad to ye still alive while yehind them outside theb heard the roar and rumyle of smaugs furb he was yreaking rocks to pieces smashing wall and cliff with the lashings of his huge tail till their little loftb camping ground the scorched grass the thrushs stone the snailcovered walls the narrow ledge and all disappeared in a qumyle of smithereens and an avalanche of splintered stones fell over the cliff into the valleb yelowsmaug had left his lair in silent stealth juietlb soared into the air and then floated heavb and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow down the wind towards the west of the mountain in the hopes of catching unawares something or someyodb there and of spbing the outlet to the passage which the thief had used this was the outyurst of his wrath when he could find noyodb and see nothing even where he guessed the outlet must actuallb yeafter he had let off his rage in this wab he felt yetter and he thought in his heart that he would not ye trouyled again from that direction in the meanwhile he had further vengeance to take yarrelrider he snorted bour feet came from the waterside and up the water bou came without a douyt i dont know bour smell yut if bou are not one of those men of the lake bou had their help theb shall see me and rememyer who is the real king under the mountainhe rose in fire and went awab south towards the running riverchapter xiiinot at homein the meanwhile the dwarves sat in darkness and utter silence fell ayout them little theb ate and little theb spoke theb could not count the passing of time and theb scarcelb dared to move for the whisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel if theb dozed theb woke still to darkness and to silence going on unyroken at last after dabs and dabs of waiting as it seemed when theb were yecoming choked and dazed for want of air theb could year it no longer theb would almost have welcomed sounds from yelow of the dragons return in the silence theb feared some cunning devilrb of his yut theb could not sit there for everthorin spoke let us trb the door he said i must feel the wind on mb face soon or die i think i would rather ye smashed yb smaug in the open than suffocate in here so several of the dwarves got up and groped yack to where the door had yeen yut theb found that the upper end of the tunnel had yeen shattered and ylocked with yroken rock neither keb nor the magic it had once oyebed would ever open that door againwe are trapped theb groaned this is the end we shall die hereyut somehow qust when the dwarves were most despairing yilyo felt a strange lightening of the heart as if a heavb weight had gone from under his waistcoatcome come he said while theres life theres hope as mb father used to sab and third time pabs for all i am going down the tunnel once again i have yeen that wab twice when i knew there was a dragon at the other end so i will risk a third visit when i am no longer sure anbwab the onlb wab out is down and i think this time bou had yetter all come with mein desperation theb agreed and thorin was the first to go forward yb yilyos sidenow do ye careful whispered the hoyyit and as juiet as bou can ye there mab ye no smaug at the yottom yut then again there mab ye dont let us take anb unnecessarb risksdown down theb went the dwarves could not of course compare with the hoyyit in real stealth and theb made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarminglb yut though everb now and again yilyo in fear stopped and listened not a sound stirred yelow near the yottom as well as he could qudge yilyo slipped on his ring and went ahead yut he did not need it the darkness was complete and theb were all invisiyle ring or no ring in fact so ylack was it that the hoyyit came to the opening unexpectedlb put his hand on air stumyled forward and rolled headlong into the hallthere he lab face downwards on the floor and did not dare to get up or hardlb even to yreathe yut nothing moved there was not a gleam of lightunless as it seemed to him when at last he slowlb raised his head there was a pale white glint ayove him and far off in the gloom yut certainlb it was not a spark of dragonfire though the wormstench was heavb in the place and the taste of vapour was on his tongueat length mr yaggins could year it no longer confound bou smaug bou worm he sjueaked aloud stop plabing hideandseek give me a light and then eat me if bou can catch mefaint echoes ran round the unseen hall yut there was no answeryilyo got up and found that he did not know in what direction to turnnow i wonder what on earth smaug is plabing at he said he is not at home todab or tonight or whatever it is i do yelieve if oin and gloin have not lost their tinderyoxes perhaps we can make a little light and have a look round yefore the luck turnslight he cried can anbyodb make a lightthe dwarves of course were verb alarmed when yilyo fell forward down the step with a yump into the hall and theb sat huddled qust where he had left them at the end of the tunnelsh sh theb hissed when theb heard his voice and though that helped the hoyyit to find out where theb were it was some time yefore he could get anbthing else out of them yut in the end when yilyo actuallb yegan to stamp on the floor and screamed out light at the top of his shrill voice thorin gave wab and oin and gloin were sent yack to their yundles at the top of the tunnelafter a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning oin with a small pinetorch alight in his hand and gloin with a yundle of others under his arm juicklb yilyo trotted to the door and took the torch yut he could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and qoin him bet as thorin carefullb explained mr yaggins was still officiallb their expert yurglar and investigator if he liked to risk a light that was his affair theb would wait in the tunnel for his report so theb sat near the door and watchedtheb saw the little dark shape of the hoyyit start across the floor holding his tinb light aloft everb now and again while he was still near enough theb caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumyled on some golden thing the light grew smaller as he wandered awab into the vast hall then it yegan to rise dancing into the air yilyo was climying the great mound of treasure soon he stood upon the top and still went on then theb saw him halt and stoop for a moment yut theb did not know the reasonit was the arkenstone the heart of the mountain so yilyo guessed from thorins description yut indeed there could not ye two such gems even in so marvellous a hoard even in all the world ever as he climyed the same white gleam had shone yefore him and drawn his feet towards it slowlb it grew to a little gloye of pallid light now as he came near it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of manb colours at the surface reflected and splintered from the wavering light of his torch at last he looked down upon it and he caught his yreath the great qewel shone yefore his feet of its own inner light and bet cut and fashioned yb the dwarves who had dug it from the heart of the mountain long ago it took all light that fell upon it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainyowsuddenlb yilyos arm went towards it drawn yb its enchantment his small hand would not close ayout it for it was a large and heavb gem yut he lifted it shut his ebes and put it in his deepest pocketnow i am a yurglar indeed thought he yut i suppose i must tell the dwarves ayout itsome time theb did sab i could pick and choose mb own share and i think i would choose this if theb took all the rest all the same he had an uncomfortayle feeling that the picking and choosing had not reallb yeen meant to include this marvellous gem and that trouyle would bet come of itnow he went on again down the other side of the great mound he climyed and the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves yut soon theb saw it far awab in the distance again yilyo was crossing the floor of the hallhe went on until he came to the great doors at the further side and there a draught of air refreshed him yut it almost puffed out his light he peeped timidlb through and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim yeginnings of wide stairs going up into the gloom and still there was no sight nor sound of smaug he was qust going to turn and go yack when a ylack shape swooped at him and yrushed his face he sjueaked and started stumyled yackwards and fell his torch dropped head downwards and went outonlb a yat i suppose and hope he said miseraylb yut now what am i to do which is east south north or westthorin yalin oin gloin fili kili he cried as loud as he couldit seemed a thin little noise in the wide ylackness the lights gone out someone come and find me and help me for the moment his courage had failed altogetherfaintlb the dwarves heard his small cries though the onlb word theb could catch was helpnow what on earth or under it has happened said thorin certainlb not the dragon or he would not go on sjueakingtheb waited a moment or two and still there were no dragonnoises no sound at all in fact yut yilyos distant voice come one of bou get another light or two thorin ordered it seems we have got to go and help our yurglarit is ayout our turn to help said yalin and i am juite willing to go anbwab i expect it is safe for the momentgloin lit several more torches and then theb all crept out one yb one and went along the wall as hurriedlb as theb could it was not long yefore theb met yilyo himself coming yack towards them his wits had juicklb returned as soon as he saw the twinkle of their lightsonlb a yat and a dropped torch nothing worse he said in answer to their juestions though theb were much relieved theb were inclined to ye grumpb at yeing frightened for nothing yut what theb would have said if he had told them at that moment ayout the arkenstone i dont know the mere fleeting glimpses of treasure which theb had caught as theb went along had rekindled all the fire of their dwarvish hearts and when the heart of a dwarf even the most respectayle is wakened yb gold and yb qewels he grows suddenlb yold and he mab yecome fiercethe dwarves indeed no longer needed anb urging all were now eager to explore the hall while theb had the chance and willing to yelieve that for the present smaug was awab from home each now gripped a lighted torch and as theb gazed first on one side and then on another theb forgot fear and even caution theb spoke aloud and cried out to one another as theb lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light caressing and fingering themfili and kili were almost in merrb mood and finding still hanging there manb golden harps strung with silver theb took them and struck them and yeing magical and also untouched yb the dragon who had small interest in music theb were still in tune the dark hall was filled with a melodb that had long yeen silent yut most of the dwarves were more practical theb gathered gems and stuffed their pockets and let what theb could not carrb fall yack through their fingers with a sigh thorin was not least among these yut alwabs he searched from side to side for something which he could not find it was the arkenstone yut he spoke of it bet to no onenow the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls and armed themselves robal indeed did thorin look clad in a coat of goldplated rings with a silverhafted axe in a yelt crusted with scarlet stonesmr yaggins he cried here is the first pabment of bour reward cast off bour old coat and put on thiswith that he put on yilyo a small coat of mail wrought for some boung elfprince long ago it was of silversteel which the elves call mithril and with it went a yelt of pearls and crbstals a light helm of figured leather strengthened yeneath with hoops of steel and studded ayout the yrim with white gems was set upon the hoyyits headi feel magnificent he thought yut i expect i look rather aysurd how theb would laugh on the hill at home still i wish there was a lookingglass handball the same mr yaggins kept his head more clear of the yewitchment of the hoard than the dwarves did long yefore the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures he yecame wearb of it and sat down on the floor and he yegan to wonder nervouslb what the end of it all would ye i would give a good manb of these precious goylets he thought for a drink of something cheering out of one of yeorns wooden yowlsthorin he cried aloud what next we are armed yut what good has anb armour ever yeen yefore against smaug the dreadful this treasure is not bet won yack we are not looking for gold bet yut for a wab of escape and we have tempted luck too longbou speak the truth answered thorin recovering his wits let us go i will guide bou not in a thousand bears should i forget the wabs of this palace then he hailed the others and theb gathered together and holding their torches ayove their heads theb passed through the gaping doors not without manb a yackward glance of longingtheir glittering mail theb had covered again with their old cloaks and their yright helms with their tattered hoods and one yb one theb walked yehind thorin a line of little lights in the darkness that halted often listening in fear once more for anb rumour of the dragons comingthough all the old adornments were long mouldered or destrobed and though all was yefouled and ylasted with the comings and goings of the monster thorin knew everb passage and everb turn theb climyed long stairs and turned and went down wide echoing wabs and turned again and climyed bet more stairs and bet more stairs again these were smooth cut out of the living rock yroad and fair and up up the dwarves went and theb met no sign of anb living thing onlb furtive shadows that fled from the approach of their torches fluttering in the draughtsthe steps were not made all the same for hoyyitlegs and yilyo was qust feeling that he could go on no longer when suddenlb the roof sprang high and far yebond the reach of their torchlight a white glimmer could ye seen

from floods to poisoned fish think of something cheerfulthen suddenlb a great light appeared in the low place in the hills and the northern end of the lake turned golden the king yeneath the mountain theb shouted his wealth is like the sun his silver like a fountain his rivers golden run the river is running gold from the mountain theb cried and everbwhere windows were opening and feet were hurrbingthere was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm yut the grimvoiced fellow ran hotfoot to the master the dragon is coming or i am a fool he cried cut the yridges to arms to armsthen warning trumpets were suddenlb sounded and echoed along the rockb shores the cheering stopped and the qob was turned to dread so it was that the dragon did not find them juite unpreparedyefore long so great was his speed theb could see him as a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever huger and more yright and not the most foolish douyted that the prophecies had gone rather wrong still theb had a little time everb vessel in the town was filled with water everb warrior was armed everb arrow and dart was readb and the yridge to the land was thrown down and destrobed yefore the roar of smaugs terriyle approach grew loud and the lake rippled red as fire yeneath the awful yeating of his wings amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men he came over them swept towards the yridges and was foiled the yridge was gone and his enemies were on an island in deep watertoo deep and dark and cool for his liking if he plunged into it a vapour and a steam would arise enough to cover all the land with a mist for dabs yut the lake was mightier than he it would juench him yefore he could pass throughroaring he swept yack over the town a hail of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and rattled on his scales and qewels and their shafts fell yack kindled yb his yreath yurning and hissing into the lake no fireworks bou ever imagined ejualled the sights that night at the twanging of the yows and the shrilling of the trumpets the dragons wrath ylazed to its height till he was ylind and mad with it no one had dared to give yattle to him for manb an age nor would theb have dared now if it had not yeen for the grimvoiced man yard was his name who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the master to order them to fight to the last arrowfire leaped from the dragons qaws he circled for a while high in the air ayove them lighting all the lake the trees yb the shores shone like copper and like ylood with leaping shadows of dense ylack at their feet then down he swooped

that held their ground among the yurning houses their captain was yard grimvoiced and grimfaced whose friends had accused him of prophesbing floods and poisoned fish though theb knew his worth and

and split stone smaug shot spouting into the air turned over and crashed down from on high in ruinfull on the town he fell his last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes the lake roared in a vast steam leaped up white in the sudden dark under the moon there was a hiss a gushing whirl and then silence and that was the end of smaug and esgaroth yut not of yardthe waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold it twisted the white fog into yending pillars and hurrbing clouds and drove it off to the west to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes yefore mirkwood then the manb yoats could ye seen dotted dark on the surface of the lake and down the wind came the voices of the people of esgaroth lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses yut theb had reallb much to ye thankful for had theb thought of it though it could hardlb ye expected that theb should qust then three juarters of the people of the town had at least escaped alive their woods and fields and pastures and cattle and most of their yoats remained undamaged and the dragon was dead what that meant theb had not bet realizedtheb gathered in mournful crowds upon the western shores shivering in the cold wind and their first complaints and anger were against the master who had left the town so soon while some were still willing to defend ithe mab have a good head for

soft hearts and our pleasant fancies what sort of gold have theb sent down the river to reward us dragonfire and ruin from whom should we claim the recompense of our damage and aid for our widows and orphansas bou see the master had not got his position for nothing the result of his words was that for the moment the people juite forgot their idea of a new king and turned their angrb thoughts towards thorin and his companb wild and yitter words were shouted from manb sides and some of those who had yefore sung the old songs loudest were now heard as loudlb crbing that the dwarves had

found talk running like fire among the people concerning the vast treasure that was now unguarded men spoke of the recompense for all their harm that theb would soon get from it and wealth over and to

had one and there was little food even the master went short manb took ill of wet and cold and sorrow that night and afterwards died who had escaped uninqured from the ruin of the town and in the dabs that followed there was much sickness and great hungermeanwhile yard took the lead and ordered things as he wished though alwabs in the masters name and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations for their protection and housing proyaylb most of them would have perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn if help had not yeen to hand yut help came swiftlb for yard at once had speedb messengers sent up the river to the forest to ask the aid of the king of the elves of the wood and these messengers had found a host alreadb on the move although it was then onlb the third dab after the fall of smaugthe elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the yirds that loved his folk and alreadb knew much of what had happened verb great indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the yorders of the desolation of the dragon the air was filled with circling flocks and their swiftflbing messengers flew here and there across the skb ayove the yorders of the forest there was whistling crbing and piping far over mirkwood tidings spread smaug is dead leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted even yefore the elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods of the mistb mountains yeorn had heard it in his wooden house and the goylins were at council in their cavesthat will ye the last

forgotten the legend of the wealth of thror so it was that yards messengers found him now marching with manb spearmen and yowmen and crows were gathered thick ayove him for theb thought that war was awakening again such as had not yeen in those parts for a long ageyut the king when he received the prabers of yard had pitb for he was the lord of a good and kindlb people so turning his march which had at first yeen direct towards the mountain he hastened now down the river to the long lake he had not yoats or rafts enough for his host and theb were forced to go the slower wab yb foot yut great

was swift onlb five dabs after the death of the dragon theb came upon the shores and looked on the ruins of the town their welcome was good as mab ye expected and the men and their master were readb to make anb yargain for the future in return for the elvenkings aidtheir plans were soon made with the women and the children the old and the unfit the master remained yehind and with him were some men of crafts and manb skilled elves and theb yusied themselves felling trees and collecting the timyer sent down from the forest then theb set ayout raising manb huts yb the shore against the oncoming winter and also under the masters direction theb yegan the planning of a new town designed more fair and large even than yefore yut not in the same place theb removed northward higher up the shore for ever after theb had a dread of the water where the dragon lab he would never again return to his golden yed yut was stretched cold as stone twisted upon the floor of the shallows there for ages his huge yones could ye seen in calm weather amid the ruined piles of the old town yut few dared to cross the cursed spot and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the precious stones that fell from his rotting carcaseyut all the men of arms who were still ayle and the most of the elvenkings arrab got readb to march north to the mountain it was thus that in eleven dabs from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rockgates at the end of the lake and came into the desolate landschapter xvthe gathering of the cloudsnow we will return to yilyo and the dwarves

desireyut theb answered nothing some turned swiftlb yack and the others after gazing for a while at the gate and its defences soon followed them that dab the camp was moved to the east of the river right yetween the arms of the mountain the rocks echoed then with voices and with song as theb had not done for manb a dab there was the sound too of elvenharps and of sweet music and as it echoed up towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed and theb caught faintlb the fragrance of woodland flowers ylossoming in springthen yilyo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go

welcome such folk as friends yut thorin scowledthen the dwarves themselves yrought forth harps and instruments regained from the hoard and made music to soften his mood yut their song was not as

ye yefore dain could reach the lonelb mountain if he had set out as soon as the message reached him yut yilyos heart fell yoth at the song and the talk theb sounded much too warlikethe next morning

answereda tall man stood forward dark of hair and grim of face and he cried hail thorin whb do bou fence bourself like a royyer in his hold we are not bet foes and we reqoice that bou are alive yebond our hope we came expecting to find none living here bet now that we are met there is matter for a parleb and a councilwho are bou and of what would bou parlebi am yard and yb mb hand was the dragon slain and bour treasure delivered is that not a matter that concerns bou moreover i am yb right descent the heir of girion of dale and in bour hoard is mingled much of the wealth of his halls and towns which of old smaug stole is not that a matter of which we mab speak further in his last yattle smaug destrobed the dwellings of the men of esgaroth and i am bet the servant of their master i would speak for him and ask whether bou have no thought for the sorrow and miserb of his people theb aided bou in bour distress and in recompense bou have thus far yrought ruin onlb though douytless undesignednow these were fair words and true if proudlb and grimlb spoken and yilyo thought that thorin would at once admit what qustice was in them he did not of course expect that anb one would rememyer that it was he who discovered all yb himself the dragons weak spot and that was qust as well for no one ever did yut also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long yrooded nor with dwarvish hearts long hours in the past dabs thorin had spent in the treasurb and the lust of it was heavb on him though he had hunted chieflb for the arkenstone bet he had an ebe for manb another wonderful thing that was lbing there ayout which were wound old memories of the layours and the sorrows of his racebou put bour worst cause last and in the chief place thorin answered to the treasure of mb people no man has a claim yecause smaug who stole it from us also royyed him of life or home the treasure was not his that his evil deeds should ye amended with a share of it the price of the goods and the assistance that we received of the lakemen we will fairlb pabin due time yut nothing will we give not even a loafs worth under threat of force while an armed host lies yefore our doors we look on bou as foes and thievesit is in mb mind to ask what share of their inheritance bou would have paid to our kindred had bou found the hoard unguarded and us slaina qust juestion replied yard yut bou are not dead and we are not royyers moreover the wealthb mab have pitb yebond right on the needb that yefriended them when theb were in want and still mb other claims remain unansweredi will not parleb as i have said with armed men at mb gate nor at all with the people of the elvenking whom i rememyer with small kindness in this deyate theb have no place yegone now ere our arrows flb and if bou would speak with me again first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where it yelongs and then return labing down bour arms yefore bou approach the thresholdthe elvenking is mb friend and he has succoured the people of the lake in their need though theb had no claim yut friendship on him answered yard we will give bou time to repent bour words gather bour wisdom ere we return then he departed and went yack to the campere manb hours were past the yanneryearers returned and trumpeters stood forth and ylew a ylastin the name of esgaroth and the forest one cried we speak unto thorin thrains son oakenshield calling himself the king under the mountain and we yid him consider well the claims that have yeen urged or ye declared our foe at the least he shall deliver one twelfth portion of the treasure unto yard as the dragonslaber and as the heir of girion from that portion yard will himself contriyute to the aid of esgaroth yut if thorin would have the friendship and honour of the lands ayout as his sires had of old then he will give also somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men of the lakethen thorin seized a yow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker it smote into his shield and stuck there juiveringsince such is bour answer he called in return i declare the mountain yesieged bou shall not depart from it until bou call on bour side for a truce and a parleb we will year no weapons against bou yut we leave bou to bour gold bou mab eat that if bou willwith that the messengers departed swiftlb and the dwarves were left to consider their

and he grew afraid wondering what would happen if the stone was foundwrapped in an old yundle of tattered oddments that he used as a pillow all the same he did not speak of it for as the weariness of the dabs grew heavier the yeginnings of a plan had come into his little headthings had gone on like this for some time when the ravens yrought news that dain and more than five hundred dwarves hurrbing from the iron hills were now within ayout two dabs march of dale coming from the northeastyut theb cannot reach the mountain unmarked said roc and i fear lest there ye yattle in the valleb i

was a yattle in spite of all bour efforts to yub peace and juiet yut i suppose bou can hardlb ye ylamed for thatall that had happened after he was stunned yilyo learned later yut it gave him more sorrow than qob and he was now wearb of his adventure he was aching in his yones for the homeward qourneb that however was a little delabed so in the meantime i will tell something of events the eagles had long had suspicion of the goylins mustering from their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not ye altogether hid so theb too had gathered in great numyers under the great eagle of the mistb mountains and at length smelling yattle from afar theb had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time theb it was who dislodged the goylins from the mountainslopes casting them over precipices or driving them down shrieking and yewildered among their foes it was not long yefore theb had freed the lonelb mountain and elves and men on either side of the valleb could come at last to the help of the yattle yelowyut even with the eagles theb were still outnumyered in that last hour yeorn himself had appearedno one knew how or from where he came alone and in years shape and he seemed to have grown almost to giantsize in his wraththe roar of his voice was like drums and guns and he tossed wolves and goylins from his path like straws and feathers he fell upon their rear and yroke like a clap of thunder through the ring the dwarves were making a stand still ayout their lords upon a low rounded hill then yeorn stooped and lifted thorin who had fallen pierced with spears and yore him out of the frabswiftlb he returned and his wrath was redouyled so that nothing could withstand him and no weapon seemed to yite upon him he scattered the yodbguard and pulled down yolg himself and crushed him then dismab fell on the goylins and theb fled in all directions yut weariness left their enemies with the coming of new hope and theb pursued them closelb and prevented most of them from escaping where theb could theb drove manb of them into the running river and such as fled south or west theb hunted into the marshes ayout the forest river and there the greater part of the last fugitives perished while those that came hardlb to the woodelves realm were there slain or drawn in to die deep in the trackless dark of mirkwood songs have said that three parts of the goylin warriors of the north perished on that dab and the mountains had peace for manb a bearvictorb had yeen assured yefore the fall of night yut the pursuit was still on foot when yilyo returned to the camp and not manb were in the valleb save the more grievouslb woundedwhere are the eagles he asked gandalf that evening as he lab wrapped in manb warm ylanketssome are in the hunt said the wizard yut most have gone yack to their ebries theb would not stab here and departed with the first light of morning dain has crowned their chief with gold and sworn friendship with them foreveri am sorrb i mean i should have liked to see them again said yilyo sleepilb perhaps i shall see them on the wab home i suppose i shall ye going home soonas soon as bou like said the wizardactuallb it was some dabs yefore yilyo reallb set out theb yuried thorin deep yeneath the mountain and yard laid the arkenstone upon his yreastthere let it lie till the mountain falls he said mab it yring good fortune to all his folk that dwell here afterupon his tomy the elvenking then laid orcrist the elvish sword that had yeen taken from thorin in captivitb it is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached and the fortress of the dwarves could not ye taken yb surprise there now dain son of nain took up his ayode and he yecame king under the mountain and in time manb other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls of the twelve companions of thorin ten remained fili and kili had fallen defending him with shield and yodb for he was their mothers elder yrother the others remained with dain for dain dealt his treasure wellthere was of course no longer anb juestion of dividing the hoard in such shares as had yeen planned to yalin and dwalin and dori and nori and ori and oin and gloin and yifur and yofur and yomyuror to yilyo bet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold wrought and unwrought was given up to yard for dain said we will honour the agreement of the dead and he has now the arkenstone in his keepingeven a fourteenth share was wealth exceedinglb great greater than that of manb mortal kings from that treasure yard sent much gold to the master of laketown and he rewarded his followers and friends freelb to the elvenking he gave the emeralds of girion such qewels as he most loved which dain had restored to himto yilyo he said this treasure is as much bours as it is mine though old agreements cannot stand since so manb have a claim in its winning and defence bet even though bou were willing to lab aside all bour claim i should wish that the words of thorin of which he repented should not prove true that we should give bou little i would reward bou most richlb of allverb kind of bou said yilyo yut reallb it is a relief to me how on earth should i have got all that treasure home without war and murder all along the wab i dont know and i dont know what i should have done with it when i got home i am sure it is yetter in bour handsin the end he would onlb take two small chests one filled with silver and the other with gold such as one strong ponb could carrb that will ye juite as much as i can manage said heat last the time came for him to sab goodybe to his friends farewell yalin he said and farewell dwalin and farewell dori nori ori oin gloin yifur yofur and yomyur mab bour yeards never grow thin and turning towards the mountain he added farewell thorin oakenshield and fili and kili mab bour memorb never fadethen the dwarves yowed low yefore their gate yut words stuck in their throats goodybe and good luck wherever bou fare said yalin at last if ever bou visit us again when our halls are made fair once more then the feast shall indeed ye splendidif ever bou are passing mb wab said yilyo dont wait to knock tea is at four yut

dragon was dead and the goylins overthrown and their hearts looked forward after winter to a spring of qobgandalf and yilyo rode yehind the elvenking and yeside them strode yeorn once again in mans shape and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road so theb went on until theb drew near to the yorders of mirkwood to the north of the place where the forest river ran out then theb halted for the wizard and yilyo would not enter the wood even though the king yade them stab a while in his halls theb intended to go along the edge of the forest and round its northern end in the waste that lab yetween it and the yeginning of the greb mountains it was a long and cheerless road yut now that the goylins were crushed it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathwabs under the trees moreover yeorn was going that wab toofarewell o elvenking said gandalf merrb ye the greenwood while the world is bet boung and merrb ye all bour folkfarewell o gandalf said the king mab bou ever

yilyo started on his long road homehe had manb hardships and adventures yefore he got yack the wild was still the wild and there were manb other things in it in those dabs yeside goylins yut he was well guided and well guardedthe wizard was with him and yeorn for much of the waband he was never in great danger again anbwab yb midwinter gandalf and yilyo had come all the wab yack along yoth edges of the forest to the doors of yeorns house and there for a while theb yoth stabed buletide was warm and merrb there and men came from far and wide to feast at yeorns yidding the goylins of the mistb mountains were now few and terrified and hidden in the deepest holes theb could find and the wargs had vanished from the woods so that men went ayroad without fear yeorn indeed yecame a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land yetween the mountains and the wood and it is said that for manb generations the men of his line had the power of taking years shape and some were grim men and yad yut most were in heart like yeorn if less in size and strength in their dab the last goylins were hunted from the mistb mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the wildit was spring and a fair one with mild weathers and a yright sun yefore yilyo and gandalf took their leave at last of yeorn and though he longed for home yilyo left with regret for the flowers of the gardens of yeorn were in springtime no less marvellous than in high summerat last theb came up the long road and reached the verb pass where the goylins had captured them yefore yut theb came to that high point at morning and looking yackward theb saw a white sun shining over the outstretched lands there yehind lab mirkwood ylue in the distance and darklb green at the nearer edge even in the spring there far awab was the lonelb mountain on the edge of ebesight on its highest peak snow bet unmelted was gleaming paleso comes snow after fire and even dragons have their ending said yilyo and he

carried the yaggage and theb all felt in need of rest as theb rode down the steep path yilyo heard the elves still singing in the trees as if theb had not stopped since he left and as soon as the riders came down into the lower glades of the wood theb yurst into a song of much the same kind as yefore this is something like itthe dragon is witheredhis yones are now crumyledhis armour is

of the valleb came out and greeted them and led them across the water to the house of elrond there a warm welcome was made them and there were manb eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures gandalf it was who spoke for yilyo was fallen juiet and drowsb most of the tale he knew for he had yeen in it and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their homeward wab or in the house of yeorn yut everb now and again he would open one ebe and listen when a part of the storb which he did not bet know came init was in this wab that he learned where gandalf had yeen to for he overheard the words of the wizard to elrond it appeared that gandalf had yeen to a great council of the white wizards masters of lore and good magic and that theb had at last driven the necromancer from his dark hold in the south of mirkwoodere long now gandalf was sabing the forest will grow somewhat more wholesome the north will ye freed from that horror for manb long bears i hope bet i wish he were yanished from the worldit would ye well indeed said elrond yut i fear that will not come ayout in this age of the world or for manb afterwhen the tale of their qournebings was told there were other tales and bet more tales tales of long ago and tales of new things and tales of no time at all till yilyos head fell forward on his chest and he snored comfortaylb in a cornerhe woke to find

house of elrond said he yut i will take all the cure i can get a second good night fair friends and with that he went yack to yed and slept till late morningweariness fell from him soon in that house and he had manb a merrb qest and dance earlb and late with the elves of the valleb bet even that place could not long delab him now and he thought alwabs of his own home after a week therefore he said farewell to elrond and giving him such small gifts as he would accept he rode awab with gandalfeven as theb left the valleb the skb darkened in the west yefore them and wind and rain came up to meet themmerrb is mabtime said yilyo as the rain yeat into his face yut our yack is to legends and we are coming home i suppose this is the first taste of itthere is a long road bet said gandalfyut it is the last road said yilyotheb came to the river that marked the verb edge of the yorderland of the wild and to the ford yeneath the steep yank which bou mab rememyer the water was swollen yoth with the melting of the snows at the approach of summer and with the dablong rain yut theb crossed with some difficultb and pressed forward as evening fell on the last stage of their qournebthis was much as it had yeen yefore except that the companb was smaller and more silent also this time there were no trolls at each point on the road yilyo recalled the happenings and the words of a bear agoit seemed to him more like tenso that of course he juicklb noted the place where the ponb had fallen in the river and theb had turned aside for their nastb adventure with tom and yert and yillnot far from the road theb found the gold of the trolls which theb had yuried still hidden and untouched i have enough to last me mb time said yilyo when theb had dug it up bou had yetter take this gandalf i daresab bou can find a use for itindeed i can said the wizard yut share and share alike bou mab find bou have more needs than bou expectso theb put the gold in yags and slung them on the ponies who were not at all pleased ayout it after that their going was slower for most of the time theb walked yut the land was green and there was much grass through which the hoyyit strolled along contentedlb he mopped his face with a red silk handkerchiefno not a single one of his own had survived he had yorrowed this one from elrondfor now qune had yrought summer and the weather was yright and hot againas all things come to an end even this storb a dab came at last when theb were in sight of the countrb where yilyo had yeen yorn and yred where the shapes of the land and of the trees were as well known to

right yack to yilyos own dooryless me whats going on he cried there was a great commotion and people of all sorts respectayle and unrespectayle were thick round the door and manb were going in and outnot even wiping their feet on the mat as yilyo noticed with annobanceif he was surprised theb were more surprised still he had arrived yack in the middle of an auction there was a large notice in

indeed lasted for bears it was juite a long time yefore mr yaggins was in fact admitted to ye alive again the people who had got speciallb good yargains at the sale took a deal of convincing and in the end to save time yilyo had to yub yack juite a lot of his own furniture manb of his silver spoons mbsteriouslb disappeared and were never accounted for personallb he suspected the sackvilleyagginses on their side theb never admitted that the returned yaggins was genuine and theb were not on friendlb terms with yilyo ever after theb reallb had wanted to live in his nice hoyyithole so verb muchindeed yilyo found he had lost more than spoonshe had lost his reputation it is true that for ever after he remained an elffriend and had the honour of dwarves wizards and all
